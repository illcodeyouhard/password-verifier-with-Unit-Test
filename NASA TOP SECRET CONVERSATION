         1                MR. McALISTER:  Good morning and              09:05:27

         2      welcome, everybody, to the first meeting of the         09:05:31

         3      Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans                 09:05:33

         4      Committee.  I just wanted to welcome everybody.         09:05:38

         5      It's been a very good turnout today.  I'm glad          09:05:41

         6      you guys could join us.  And to everybody that's        09:05:45

         7      watching on the computer and on NASA TV, we want        09:05:47

         8      to welcome you as well.                                 09:05:50

         9                My name is Phil McAlister.  I'm the           09:05:51

        10      executive director of the committee.  Just a            09:05:54

        11      couple of quick notes.                                  09:05:54

        12                This meeting is governed by the               09:05:57

        13      Federal Advisory Committee Act.  So this is a           09:05:59

        14      public meeting obviously.  All of the comments          09:06:01

        15      today are on the record.                                09:06:04

        16                I ask that you please silence your            09:06:06

        17      cell phones -- it's just like the movie                 09:06:09

        18      theaters -- so that we can get through the              09:06:13

        19      agenda, which is very challenging today.                09:06:13

        20                All of the presentations today will be        09:06:15

        21      posted on the committee's website as well as the        09:06:17

        22      minutes today.  The committees's website is             09:06:18


                                                                7



         1      http://hsf.nasa.gov.  So please visit there.  We        09:06:23

         2      do have copies of the agenda also that are              09:06:33

         3      available for anybody who wants to see it.              09:06:35

         4                Let's see.  I will be notifying the           09:06:38

         5      presenters about five minutes before their end          09:06:40

         6      so that we can make sure that we get through            09:06:43

         7      everything.                                             09:06:45

         8                I also wanted to mention that all             09:06:46

         9      members of the committee have been reviewed by          09:06:48

        10      NASA's legal counsel, they've analyzed all              09:06:50

        11      potential conflicts of interest and they've             09:06:50

        12      resolved all and -- any and all significant             09:06:55

        13      conflicts in consultation with the Office of            09:06:57

        14      Government Ethics.  So we're in good shape              09:06:58

        15      there.                                                  09:07:00

        16                There's going to be two public                09:07:00

        17      comments periods today, one right before lunch          09:07:03

        18      and then one right at the end of today.  We're          09:07:05

        19      very much looking forward to that, and we're            09:07:08

        20      going to ask people to come to one of the two           09:07:10

        21      standing microphones during those periods and           09:07:11

        22      make your comments.  If you could limit your            09:07:15


                                                                8



         1      comments to about three -- no more than three           09:07:17

         2      minutes, that would be preferable.  We'd like to        09:07:19

         3      get as much public comment in as possible.              09:07:23

         4                We'd also request that you -- we would        09:07:25

         5      strongly prefer that you ask questions via the          09:07:27

         6      website.  So if you have questions today, it            09:07:31

         7      would be much better to submit those on the             09:07:33

         8      website so that we can answer them and they can         09:07:33

         9      be posted on the public's -- the website for all        09:07:35

        10      of the public to see.                                   09:07:38

        11                So for today, we're predominantly             09:07:41

        12      looking for comments from the public for those          09:07:44

        13      two periods.                                            09:07:47

        14                For members of the media, we'd also           09:07:49

        15      like those public comment periods to be before          09:07:49

        16      the public.  We've set aside a half hour at the         09:07:50

        17      end of the day today at 5:00 for the media where        09:07:52

        18      the chair, Norm Augustine, will be made                 09:07:56

        19      available to answer all of those questions.             09:08:00

        20                With that, I'd like to turn it over to        09:08:02

        21      our chair, Norm Augustine.                              09:08:05

        22                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Thank you,             09:08:08


                                                                9



         1      Phil.                                                   09:08:08

         2                Good morning, everyone.  Your presence        09:08:09

         3      today and the interest we've found in our               09:08:12

         4      assignment, I think, speaks to the care and the         09:08:12

         5      importance that is assigned to the topic.               09:08:15

         6                I would encourage you, as Phil did, to        09:08:21

         7      use our website.  It's set up to handle a very          09:08:24

         8      large capacity.  We've already received a lot of        09:08:28

         9      comments, and we look forward to more.                  09:08:31

        10                I'm not going to take time to                 09:08:34

        11      introduce all of my colleagues.  Their names are        09:08:37

        12      in front of them, and you probably know many of         09:08:39

        13      them.  Their biographies are on the website.            09:08:40

        14                Three of our members had commitments          09:08:42

        15      prior to their knowing they were going to be            09:08:46

        16      doing this this summer.  So we are depending a          09:08:48

        17      lot on wiring people in by videoconference and          09:08:51

        18      telephone conference, and that seems to work            09:08:54

        19      very well.                                              09:08:57

        20                We've been able to take some                  09:08:58

        21      preparatory steps for this meeting.  There are          09:09:00

        22      some administrative things we've set up.  Let me        09:09:02

         1      quickly cover them so you'll kind of know where         09:09:06

         2      we are.                                                 09:09:09

         3                In terms of administrative actions,           09:09:10

         4      we've set up four task groups or subgroups that         09:09:14

         5      will be working on specific aspects of the              09:09:17

         6      overall charter that we've been given.                  09:09:21

         7                We have taken steps to have the               09:09:23

         8      Aerospace Corporation assist our panel directly.        09:09:26

         9      They will be responding to tasks that we may            09:09:30

        10      assign them, where we'd like to get more detail         09:09:33

        11      and more background than we may have ourselves          09:09:37

        12      as the members.                                         09:09:42

        13                Today we're just going to be able to          09:09:42

        14      do a snapshot overview.  We'll be going into            09:09:45

        15      much greater depth as time goes on and through          09:09:49

        16      our subgroups.                                          09:09:52

        17                And as Phil said, I've asked him to           09:09:53

        18      kind of keep us on time as the day goes on.             09:09:55

        19                And so with that, the first thing I'd         09:09:58

        20      like to do, it's my privilege to introduce              09:10:00

        21      Dr. John Holdren, whom you know is the science          09:10:05

        22      advisor to the President and also the head of           09:10:08


                                                               11



         1      the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and        09:10:10

         2      it was really, I think, in large part, his              09:10:15

         3      efforts that brought about this review.                 09:10:19

         4                John, we'd surely welcome any comments        09:10:22

         5      you'd like to share with us.                            09:10:26

         6                DR. HOLDREN:  Well, thank you, Norm.          09:10:28

         7      And I want to start by thanking you and the             09:10:30

         8      panel for stepping up to the challenge of               09:10:33

         9      conducting this assessment of the future of U.S.        09:10:36

        10      participation in human space flight.                    09:10:42

        11                The President is grateful to you for          09:10:43

        12      this service.  I'm grateful.  NASA Acting               09:10:47

        13      Administrator Chris Scolese is grateful.  And           09:10:51

        14      I'm sure the nominee for director of NASA,              09:10:55

        15      General Bolden, would be grateful too if he were        09:11:03

        16      allowed to comment publicly on anything before          09:11:01

        17      his confirmation.                                       09:11:02

        18                I want to start by emphasizing, to put        09:11:06

        19      this in context, the importance that                    09:11:12

        20      President Obama places on science and                   09:11:14

        21      technology, in general, as keys to the country's        09:11:18

        22      ability to address the great challenges we face         09:11:20


                                                               12



         1      across a very wide array of issues, as you know,        09:11:22

         2      including the economy, health, energy, climate          09:11:23

         3      change, other resource and environmental issues,        09:11:26

         4      national and homeland security.  We face a truly        09:11:30

         5      haunting array of challenges across these               09:11:34

         6      domains, and only with a major contribution from        09:11:38

         7      innovation driven by science, engineering and,          09:11:41

         8      indeed, the social sciences as well are we going        09:11:46

         9      to be able to meet those challenges effectively.        09:11:50

        10      Our capabilities in space are a very important          09:11:53

        11      part of that.                                           09:11:57

        12                I like to think of our capacity to            09:11:58

        13      meet that whole array of challenges as defined          09:12:00

        14      by a set of cross-cutting foundational                  09:12:03

        15      capabilities which include the health of our            09:12:07

        16      great fundamental research institutions, our            09:12:10

        17      research universities, national and private             09:12:12

        18      laboratories; the capabilities of our                   09:12:15

        19      infrastructure, information technology,                 09:12:16

        20      transportation, communications, energy; the             09:12:19

        21      capacity of our teaching institutions in                09:12:24

        22      science, technology, engineering and math               09:12:28


                                                               13



         1      education from preschool to grad school and             09:12:30

         2      beyond.                                                 09:12:33

         3                And I think of space as one of those          09:12:35

         4      foundational cross-cutting sets of capabilities         09:12:39

         5      that are essential to our ability to meet the           09:12:41

         6      full array of applied challenges that we face.          09:12:42

         7                Space, of course, is also a marvelous         09:12:47

         8      venue for expanding fundamental knowledge, for          09:12:50

         9      improving our understanding of the universe and         09:12:56

        10      our place in it.  It's a wonderful vantage point        09:12:59

        11      for looking down as well as looking up for              09:13:04

        12      understanding what's happening on the surface of        09:13:07

        13      the Earth, whether it be changes in land use,           09:13:11

        14      emissions of various pollutants, activities that        09:13:12

        15      we need to understand to monitor our arms               09:13:16

        16      control agreements -- a huge array of important         09:13:16

        17      functions of looking down.                              09:13:20

        18                Space is also historically and in the         09:13:20

        19      present a way of inspiring the next generation          09:13:23

        20      to take an interest in science, technology,             09:13:26

        21      engineering and math.  It fulfilled that                09:13:29

        22      function admirably during the space race, when a        09:13:32


                                                               14



         1      whole generation of scientists and engineers --         09:13:36

         2      including, I should say, myself -- were inspired        09:13:36

         3      to go into science and technology, in part,             09:13:38

         4      because of the attractions and allure of space.         09:13:41

         5      It continues along with other challenges to be          09:13:45

         6      able to play that role.                                 09:13:47

         7                And, of course, human space flight is         09:13:47

         8      a particularly important component of that.  The        09:13:52

         9      extraordinary capabilities, the extraordinary           09:13:57

        10      achievements, one only had to look at the               09:14:00

        11      shuttle mission to the Hubble most recently --          09:14:05

        12      five space walks, extraordinary accomplishments         09:14:09

        13      in fixing things that were never designed to be         09:14:14

        14      fixed in space by astronauts using their                09:14:19

        15      ingenuity and responding on the spur of the             09:14:22

        16      moment to the conditions they faced --                  09:14:24

        17      underlined why it is, always has been and always        09:14:24

        18      will be important to be able to put human beings        09:14:29

        19      in space.                                               09:14:29

        20                Robotic space exploration is important        09:14:31

        21      too.  The other missions of NASA are important          09:14:35

        22      in fundamental science, in Earth observation, in        09:14:38


                                                               15



         1      aeronautics, but we have to maintain the                09:14:42

         2      viability of our Human Space Flight program.            09:14:45

         3                The President is determined to do             09:14:48

         4      that.  He's committed to human space flight.            09:14:50

         5      He's excited by human space flight.  He has             09:14:54

         6      spoken with the astronauts while they were in           09:14:57

         7      orbit in each mission that has taken place since        09:15:00

         8      he was inaugurated.  He'll continue to do that.         09:15:01

         9                He met with the Discovery astronauts          09:15:04

        10      after they returned.  I'm sure we'll met with           09:15:08

        11      the Atlantis astronauts as well.                        09:15:08

        12                This is a president who gets it.  He          09:15:12

        13      understands the importance of space.  He                09:15:14

        14      understands the importance of human space               09:15:17

        15      flight.  He was clear in his campaign and since         09:15:19

        16      about his commitment to continue U.S. leadership        09:15:22

        17      in space, to go back to the Moon, other                 09:15:26

        18      destinations beyond low Earth orbit.                    09:15:30

        19                And so the work of this panel is truly        09:15:31

        20      important to the President, important to me,            09:15:34

        21      important to the leadership of NASA as a way of         09:15:37

        22      making sure that we have assessed all of the            09:15:40


                                                               16



         1      reasonable options for our Human Space Flight           09:15:45

         2      program going forward, to make sure we have the         09:15:49

         3      best answers possible to the question of how to         09:15:54

         4      minimum the gap in our capacity to put U.S.             09:15:56

         5      astronauts into space on U.S. launchers, the gap        09:16:00

         6      that will ensue after the scheduled end of the          09:16:03

         7      shuttle program at the end of 2010 and the              09:16:06

         8      beginning of the capacities to put U.S.                 09:16:08

         9      astronauts in space in the Constellation                09:16:11

        10      program.                                                09:16:14

        11                The panel will be looking at the              09:16:14

        12      challenges of how to utilize the International          09:16:16

        13      Space Station after 2016.  It will be looking at        09:16:21

        14      the various kinds of balancing that have to be          09:16:25

        15      done in NASA in an environment of constrained           09:16:29

        16      budgets among the different missions and the            09:16:32

        17      different components of NASA's activities.  It          09:16:35

        18      is a daunting challenge for the panel, but              09:16:37

        19      one -- when I review the qualifications of this         09:16:43

        20      extraordinary group, one which I really could           09:16:45

        21      not imagine finding a more qualified set of             09:16:48

        22      people to address this set of issues.                   09:16:51


                                                               17



         1                Of course, one possibility is that the        09:16:53

         2      panel will conclude that the -- is that the             09:16:54

         3      course we're already on is the best one                 09:16:56

         4      available, and we will stay on it.  It may also         09:16:58

         5      conclude that are there are variations that             09:17:02

         6      should be pursued.  And I know that this panel,         09:17:04

         7      with its extraordinary set of abilities and the         09:17:07

         8      independence and integrity of all of its                09:17:10

         9      members, will tell us whatever it is they think         09:17:13

        10      we need to hear about those options going               09:17:17

        11      forward.                                                09:17:21

        12                We are looking, as Norm and the panel         09:17:21

        13      already know, to get the panel's findings by            09:17:26

        14      sometime in August in order to be able to               09:17:30

        15      influence a whole series of decisions that the          09:17:33

        16      NASA leadership and the Administration will be          09:17:36

        17      making going forward.  That timing, too, is a           09:17:39

        18      great challenge.                                        09:17:43

        19                And, again, all I can do is express my        09:17:43

        20      gratitude and the President's and that of Chris         09:17:46

        21      Scolese, who for understandable reasons happens         09:17:50

        22      to be in Florida at the moment, to the panel for        09:17:54


                                                               18



         1      taking this on.  I know that what you find will         09:17:57

         2      be of immense use to us as we figure out how to         09:18:01

         3      move forward in the most expeditious way with           09:18:06

         4      this immensely important program.                       09:18:10

         5                So thank you again very much.                 09:18:12

         6                And thank you all in the audience for         09:18:13

         7      coming to this first public meeting of the Human        09:18:15

         8      Space Flight Review.                                    09:18:19

         9                MR. AUGUSTINE:  John, thank you very,         09:18:21

        10      very much for being here and for the support you        09:18:23

        11      and your office have given to us.                       09:18:25

        12                When I think about all of the                 09:18:27

        13      challenges our nation faces, space being just           09:18:29

        14      one of them, so many of them are rich in                09:18:32

        15      technology and science, and we couldn't have a          09:18:36

        16      better person in the position of advising the           09:18:39

        17      President on those issues than Dr. John Holdren.        09:18:41

        18                So, again, John, thanks for being             09:18:45

        19      here, and thanks for what you're doing.                 09:18:46

        20                We now would like to hear from                09:18:50

        21      Mr. Chris Scolese, who is the acting                    09:18:53

        22      administrator of NASA, as you know, who has             09:18:57


                                                               19



         1      filled that job for some months now.  And we've         09:18:59

         2      had the chance to visit with him briefly before,        09:19:02

         3      and we'll be spending a good deal of time with          09:19:05

         4      him.  And we've also had a chance to just very          09:19:07

         5      briefly have conversations with his successor,          09:19:11

         6      who we'll be able to speak with more when he's          09:19:18

         7      officially in position.                                 09:19:15

         8                But Mr. Scolese has agreed to make a          09:19:19

         9      few remarks this morning, and if everything             09:19:24

        10      works the way we hope it will and it looks like         09:19:26

        11      it is, Chris, welcome, and we'd love to hear not        09:19:28

        12      only your comments on this panel but what's             09:19:32

        13      happening where you are.                                09:19:32

        14                (Whereupon, Mr. Scolese presented his         09:19:32

        15      comments via videoconference as follows:                09:19:34

        16                MR. SCOLESE:  Okay.  Good morning.            09:19:34

        17      Well, I guess I'll start with what's happening          09:19:38

        18      down here.  We, of course, had to scrub the             09:19:41

        19      launch last night.                                      09:19:46

        20                We have detected a leak in the GUP            09:19:47

        21      with the area where we vent the liquid                  09:19:52

        22      hydrogen -- the gaseous hydrogen.  The size of          09:19:56


                                                               20



         1      the leak is about the size of a pinhole.  So            09:20:03

         2      it's a -- it's very small, but still it's               09:20:05

         3      something that we need to be concerned about.           09:20:06

         4      We don't yet have the cause for it.                     09:20:08

         5                This happened recently.  The last --          09:20:11

         6      the mission before the Hubble servicing mission,        09:20:15

         7      we were able to go in there and fill in the --          09:20:18

         8      do a replacement and a repair, and everything           09:20:22

         9      went fine.  We did the same thing this time, but        09:20:25

        10      this time we didn't succeed.                            09:20:29

        11                So we're going to have to take a step         09:20:31

        12      back, go off and look at what occurred,                 09:20:33

        13      understand the data and then go back, and we'll         09:20:35

        14      have an attempt again no earlier than the               09:20:39

        15      beginning of July when we'll try and fly this           09:20:43

        16      mission then.  But, of course, we're going to           09:20:47

        17      fly safe, and we're going to understand what            09:20:49

        18      occurred on this latest activity and then we'll         09:20:51

        19      proceed.                                                09:20:55

        20                But this morning I'd like to thank the        09:20:56

        21      panel for agreeing to do this.  We know how busy        09:20:59

        22      you all are, and we really appreciate you taking        09:21:03


                                                               21



         1      the time to go off and work on this very                09:21:07

         2      important task.  It's hard to add much more to          09:21:10

         3      what John discussed earlier.                            09:21:14

         4                This is something that's critical for         09:21:17

         5      the nation.  It's critical for NASA.  We                09:21:19

         6      recognize clearly the importance of space and           09:21:23

         7      aeronautics to the nation and to the world and          09:21:26

         8      the human space flight, in particular, that             09:21:31

         9      we're going to be reviewing here.                       09:21:34

        10                There's a number of challenges going          09:21:36

        11      on in the budget environment that we live in.           09:21:37

        12      There's a number of options that clearly can be         09:21:40

        13      considered, and we hope to hear those from you          09:21:43

        14      and work with you on that.                              09:21:49

        15                To that end, I want to assure you that        09:21:51

        16      NASA is going to be very open and thorough in           09:21:54

        17      our support of the team.  To that end, we put           09:21:58

        18      two of our best and brightest -- Phil McAlister,        09:22:02

        19      who introduced the conference, and Mike Hawes --        09:22:07

        20      to support the team.                                    09:22:11

        21                Mike is the head of our program               09:22:12

        22      analysis and evaluation.  He's uniquely suited          09:22:14


                                                               22



         1      to be able to support the team because he looks         09:22:18

         2      at the entire agency, he looks at all of the            09:22:19

         3      things that we do.  So human space flight is one        09:22:23

         4      component of that.  He has a long history in            09:22:26

         5      that activity and understands it very well.  I          09:22:28

         6      assure you -- and I've told him -- that he has          09:22:32

         7      access to everybody within the agency, and I'm          09:22:34

         8      sure Charlie Bolden, when he's on board, will           09:22:37

         9      make sure that that continues.                          09:22:41

        10                As we proceed, probably a couple of           09:22:43

        11      items worth mentioning.  I know the team is             09:22:46

        12      going to work very hard -- the review committee         09:22:50

        13      is going to work very hard looking at what we           09:22:53

        14      do.  And one of the things I -- or some of the          09:22:56

        15      things that I think are important, as you look          09:22:58

        16      at us, are to consider the mission that we have,        09:23:01

        17      to get humans out of low Earth orbit now.               09:23:06

        18      That's going to require us to do something we           09:23:09

        19      haven't done in over 40 years.                          09:23:13

        20                The challenge is going to be greater          09:23:15

        21      because this time we're not just going to go            09:23:18

        22      back to the Moon for a few visits for a few days        09:23:21


                                                               23



         1      but ultimately to travel beyond the Moon,               09:23:25

         2      ultimately to Mars and other destinations that          09:23:29

         3      will require long duration space flight.                09:23:31

         4      Critical to that, of course, is our                     09:23:31

         5      understanding of long-duration space flight and         09:23:35

         6      our International Space Station that is up there        09:23:36

         7      today crewed by six people now and beginning to         09:23:40

         8      conduct the research that we need to do to              09:23:43

         9      understand long-duration space flight.  So              09:23:46

        10      there's some components that we need to consider        09:23:50

        11      there.                                                  09:23:53

        12                I'd ask you to consider the comments          09:23:54

        13      of the CAIB that looked at the aftermath of the         09:23:57

        14      Columbia accident and made some recommendations         09:24:00

        15      to NASA about separating crew and cargo,                09:24:04

        16      providing crew escape and those types of                09:24:09

        17      activities.                                             09:24:13

        18                Also looking at our international             09:24:14

        19      partnerships, both our commitments that we have         09:24:15

        20      today but also what we need to do in the future.        09:24:18

        21      Space is an international venture.  Everything          09:24:21

        22      that we have done almost since the beginning of         09:24:24


                                                               24



         1      the Space Age has involved international                09:24:29

         2      partnerships, whether they be in our robotic            09:24:30

         3      missions or in our human space flight missions,         09:24:32

         4      and we expect that will be something that will          09:24:37

         5      be continued in the future.                             09:24:37

         6                And, of course, we have to look at our        09:24:38

         7      program and understand it in terms of the budget        09:24:41

         8      environment, the technological capabilities of          09:24:45

         9      the nation, our industrial capabilities, how we         09:24:49

        10      maintain those, our academic institutions and           09:24:53

        11      how we preserve the pipeline of scientists and          09:24:57

        12      engineers and technicians that we'll need to            09:24:58

        13      operate not only these systems but other systems        09:25:01

        14      and how we motivate them.                               09:25:04

        15                So that's really about all that I can         09:25:06

        16      add to it.  Again, I'd like to thank you for            09:25:08

        17      agreeing to serve on this commission.  I want to        09:25:11

        18      let you know that we'll listen carefully, we'll         09:25:13

        19      work with you closely and we'll work with the           09:25:16

        20      Administration as we develop responses and              09:25:19

        21      respond to the options that are presented.              09:25:22

        22                So thank you again.                           09:25:25


                                                               25



         1                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Chris, thank you very         09:25:27

         2      much and particularly under the circumstances           09:25:29

         3      where you're very busy there for taking the time        09:25:32

         4      to talk to us.                                          09:25:35

         5                The support we've received from Mike          09:25:37

         6      and Phil has been fantastic as we've tried to           09:25:39

         7      organize and get ourselves prepared to move             09:25:42

         8      ahead.                                                  09:25:45

         9                So thank you.  We look forward to             09:25:46

        10      working with you as well.                               09:25:48

        11                (Whereupon, the videoconference               09:25:48

        12      portion of the meeting was concluded.)                  09:25:48

        13                MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think that brings us        09:25:49

        14      to our first briefing, which, appropriately             09:25:50

        15      enough, is to take a look at past studies that          09:25:53

        16      have been conducted.  We're not the first to            09:25:55

        17      look at the Human Space Flight program by a long        09:25:57

        18      shot, and one of the things we'd like to do is          09:26:00

        19      to learn from those who have gone before us.            09:26:04

        20                Mike Hawes, who you heard Chris               09:26:08

        21      describe his position at NASA, has been assigned        09:26:13

        22      to give us technical support, and as I said,            09:26:13


                                                               26



         1      he's done a terrific job of it.                         09:26:17

         2                And, Mike, if you would care to give          09:26:18

         3      us a little bit of a summary of past studies            09:26:22

         4      that relate to our charter.                             09:26:25

         5                MR. HAWES:  Thank you, Norm.  That's          09:26:27

         6      exactly what I'd like to do, and I only have            09:26:29

         7      one -- well, it's actually a double-sided chart,        09:26:31

         8      and exactly as you captured, this exploration           09:26:35

         9      mission question has been studied a number of           09:26:38

        10      times by NASA and externals.                            09:26:41

        11                Some of the studies we have provided          09:26:46

        12      you in your homework packages that, you know, we        09:26:48

        13      have been sending you weekly since you got              09:26:52

        14      named.  Some of them we'll be able to hear and          09:26:53

        15      discuss in our preparatory sessions, and some of        09:26:56

        16      them you'll actually hear beginning today in            09:26:59

        17      this public session.  So that's really what I           09:27:01

        18      wanted to just set that kind of context.                09:27:05

        19                We kind of reached back and went              09:27:08

        20      back -- we didn't go all of the way back to             09:27:10

        21      Wernher von Braun, but we went back into the            09:27:14

        22      late '80s anyway and have pulled out -- and I           09:27:17


                                                               27



         1      would say that the words here are mine.  If             09:27:19

         2      anybody disagrees with the characterization of          09:27:22

         3      perhaps what the themes were in here, you can           09:27:24

         4      feel free to snarl at me, you know, outside             09:27:28

         5      during lunch or something.                              09:27:30

         6                So we start with the exploration              09:27:30

         7      office case studies back in the late '80s, the          09:27:32

         8      90-day study, which was Dr. Cohen.                      09:27:36

         9                The synthesis report, we heard a              09:27:40

        10      little bit from General Thom about the synthesis        09:27:42

        11      report.  We have provided that for you with             09:27:45

        12      copies so you have multiple versions about that.        09:27:49

        13                Followed on with the Office of                09:27:53

        14      Exploration, a lunar outpost study in '93.              09:27:57

        15                And then continuing in the theme, Dan         09:27:59

        16      Goldin, as administrator, initiated a number of         09:28:04

        17      activities that were all exploration focused.           09:28:07

        18      One was focusing on the Human Lunar Return issue        09:28:08

        19      and then an update of a Mars Design Reference           09:28:12

        20      Mission -- is what we mean by DRMS.  We have            09:28:20

        21      actually also completed some more recent work on        09:28:21

        22      updating that Mars Design Reference Mission,            09:28:22


                                                               28



         1      given the change in our technologies and                09:28:26

         2      environment.                                            09:28:28

         3                The Decadal Planning Team was another         09:28:31

         4      activity that was NASA lead that was in the             09:28:36

         5      early 2000s as we have gone through.  We have           09:28:38

         6      the output of those materials that we can               09:28:43

         7      certainly make available.                               09:28:44

         8                Chris mentioned the CAIB Report.  And         09:28:46

         9      in addition to the things that Chris highlighted        09:28:49

        10      in terms of separating crew and cargo and the           09:28:52

        11      crew safety aspects, the CAIB also took time to         09:28:55

        12      make comment on the value proposition of human          09:28:59

        13      space flight, and that value proposition being          09:29:03


        14      driven by moving beyond the low Earth orbit that        09:29:06

        15      we have been in for the last few decades.  So           09:29:10

        16      just in that aspect, I cite the CAIB for you.           09:29:13

        17                Just after the vision was released, we        09:29:19

        18      went through a variety of what we call Concept          09:29:23

        19      Exploration and Requirement studies.  We've             09:29:28

        20      actually provided you, I believe, most of those         09:29:28

        21      studies in terms of the study packages already.         09:29:32

        22      And those studies were across a very broad set          09:29:35


                                                               29



         1      of topics and several teams and companies               09:29:40

         2      involved in those.  So there's actually a wealth        09:29:44

         3      of interesting stuff here.                              09:29:48

         4                When Mike Griffin came in as                  09:29:50

         5      administrator, he kicked off what has become            09:29:53

         6      known as ESAS, the Exploration Systems                  09:29:56

         7      Architecture Study, and ESAS has set the                09:30:00

         8      foundation of where we are today.  And so much          09:30:03

         9      of what you'll hear from the baseline program           09:30:07

        10      has its roots in ESAS, but it has been grown and        09:30:11

        11      modified in ways as we have gotten really into          09:30:14

        12      the detailed design given the maturity of the           09:30:16

        13      program today.                                          09:30:20

        14                There are a few alternative options           09:30:21

        15      that are out there.  The Direct option is one           09:30:23

        16      that's well known and well publicized external          09:30:27

        17      to the agency.  We'll actually hear from the            09:30:30

        18      Direct team this afternoon.  So you'll have an          09:30:32

        19      opportunity to actually hear that.                      09:30:35

        20                We did a study within the agency that         09:30:38

        21      we called Exploration Acceleration.  This was           09:30:40

        22      done by Ralph Roe.  As you know, Ralph is on my         09:30:43


                                                               30



         1      team.  It was done with the full cooperation of         09:30:47


         2      Doug and Jeff and the whole Constellation               09:30:51

         3      program team and looked at potential ways to            09:30:55

         4      increase our cost confidence for the program,           09:30:58

         5      and I think many of the steps that Jeff and Doug        09:31:00

         6      are taking now are well tied to that study              09:31:04

         7      activity.                                               09:31:06

         8                And then we heard a little bit as             09:31:06

         9      well -- and it has been in your homework -- a           09:31:08

        10      recent Congressional Budget Office report that          09:31:10

        11      kind of lays out some of the constraints of             09:31:13

        12      various scenarios of exploration given NASA's           09:31:16

        13      budget profile.                                         09:31:20

        14                So that's the context I wanted to set.        09:31:22

        15      There are probably many more.  You will hear            09:31:24

        16      some other variations of activities today.  That        09:31:27

        17      was the goal for today -- was to get all of this        09:31:29

        18      kind of laid out on the table for the panel and         09:31:32

        19      then have you work with the NASA team to                09:31:35

        20      determine what are the actions that we need to          09:31:40

        21      take and go study in more depth.                        09:31:44

        22                Any of these that you're interested in        09:31:47


                                                               31



         1      that we haven't provided, certainly let us know,        09:31:50

         2      and we'll find a way.  Some of these predate            09:31:53

         3      our -- easily -- Electronic Age.  So we'll find         09:31:56

         4      a way to turn them into electrons so as to kill         09:31:59

         5      less trees, but we can certainly make all of            09:32:05

         6      these available for you.                                09:32:07

         7                And that's really all that I wanted to        09:32:07

         8      try to accomplish this morning.                         09:32:09

         9                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Mike, thank you very          09:32:10

        10      much.                                                   09:32:12

        11                We have been frankly inundated with           09:32:12


        12      the documentation, and we'll be putting a bunch         09:32:14

        13      of that on the website.  That which is not              09:32:16

        14      propriety or have other sensitive aspects, we           09:32:19

        15      will try to share with you as much as we've had         09:32:24

        16      available to us.                                        09:32:27

        17                The next topic on the agenda is,              09:32:27

        18      logically enough, I think, to talk about the            09:32:33

        19      existing program that's being pursued, the              09:32:34

        20      Constellation program.  Doug Cooke with NASA is         09:32:38

        21      going to give us a very quick snapshot of that          09:32:38

        22      to sort of fill out the reading material that's         09:32:38


                                                               32



         1      been available.                                         09:32:56

         2                MR. COOKE:  Thank you very much,              09:32:56

         3      Chairman Augustine.  I appreciate the                   09:32:58

         4      opportunity to talk with you and your panel.            09:33:00

         5                I represent the Exploration Systems           09:33:02

         6      Mission Directorate, and our primary program --         09:33:05

         7      most visible is the Constellation program.  We          09:33:08

         8      also have a human research program, a technology        09:33:08

         9      program, robotic program, and we also have the          09:33:13

        10      COTS and FERTS within our program.  These are           09:33:18

        11      all important to us and most of which feeds             09:33:21

        12      directly into the Constellation program and             09:33:26

        13      helps support it.                                       09:33:29

        14                Our focus at the moment is a program          09:33:30

        15      driving toward initial operating capability in          09:33:35

        16      March of 2015 with a mission to the Space               09:33:42

        17      Station with Ares I and Orion.  We do have a            09:33:43

        18      focus also long term on moving beyond the low           09:33:49

        19      Earth orbit with exploration, and that's very           09:33:53

        20      important to us.  And we have quite a bit of our        09:33:56

        21      effort in understanding the end-to-end                  09:33:58

        22      architecture that we work toward.                       09:34:00


                                                               33



         1                We have a number of milestones coming         09:34:04

         2      up very shortly.  Actually in the next three            09:34:06

         3      days we hope to launch the Lunar Reconnaissance         09:34:10

         4      Orbiter and the Lunar Crater Observation and            09:34:11

         5      Sensing Satellite, which is -- both of which are        09:34:14

         6      going to the Moon on robotic spacecraft and will        09:34:17

         7      be getting us rich data that will feed into our         09:34:22

         8      understanding of the Moon.  So we're really             09:34:24

         9      looking forward to that, and they're ready to           09:34:26

        10      go.                                                     09:34:30

        11                We also have this summer the first            09:34:30

        12      test of a five-segment solid rocket booster,            09:34:32

        13      which is the first stage of Ares I.  That will          09:34:37

        14      be in August.  We have a preliminary design             09:34:39

        15      review on Orion in August as well.  We have the         09:34:40

        16      Ares I-X first test flight in -- no earlier than        09:34:46

        17      the end -- end of August but within that general        09:34:48

        18      time frame and a Pad Abort 1 test this fall.            09:34:51

        19                And so we have a lot going on and are         09:34:57

        20      making a lot of progress.  We hope to show that         09:35:00

        21      to you in this presentation.  Next chart.               09:35:02

        22                There's a lot of discussion on vehicle        09:35:06


                                                               34



         1      concepts, but to us we need to -- we consider           09:35:09

         2      the entire mission, what is it we hope to               09:35:12

         3      accomplish.  And we have gone through an                09:35:16

         4      international set of activities and with                09:35:19

         5      13 other space agencies in developing objectives        09:35:21

         6      and themes for what we want to accomplish as we         09:35:24

         7      move forward on the Moon, in particular.                09:35:27

         8                As we have developed concepts, we look        09:35:30

         9      to this for the lunar operations, which we've           09:35:33


        10      studied a lot.  Actually we've have had teams           09:35:38

        11      going on that since 2006, to define what                09:35:41

        12      exploration means on the Moon, what is it you           09:35:44

        13      actually do and achieve.  So that has informed          09:35:45

        14      the overall transportation architecture which is        09:35:48

        15      shown here.                                             09:35:51

        16                And so as you develop those lunar             09:35:52

        17      scenarios, we came up with the idea of an               09:35:55

        18      outpost at a polar location.  That tends to             09:35:59

        19      drive your lander, which then backs up                  09:36:01

        20      into end-to-end importance understanding on your        09:36:03

        21      entire end-to-end transportation architecture           09:36:07

        22      with the appropriate allocation of mass and             09:36:09


                                                               35



         1      performance margins to all of the vehicles so           09:36:13

         2      that end to end it all closes and it works.             09:36:16

         3                So this is an integrated architecture         09:36:19

         4      that we've been working on, and it has informed         09:36:24

         5      our current vehicles.  The performance obviously        09:36:26

         6      affects the designs and performance of Ares I           09:36:28

         7      and actually the Orion.                                 09:36:32

         8                Things like translunar injection              09:36:36

         9      loads -- when we fire up the Earth departure            09:36:40

        10      stage to send Orion and the lander to the Moon,         09:36:44

        11      you have loads, and those loads have been               09:36:49

        12      studied and has affected the structural design          09:36:49

        13      of Orion, for instance.                                 09:36:51

        14                So all of this is being worked in an          09:36:53

        15      integrated fashion as we develop and mature the         09:36:55

        16      design for Orion and Ares I.  We can go to the          09:37:00

        17      next chart.                                             09:37:03

        18                We also have a number of top level            09:37:04

        19      objectives.  We have a cascading set of                 09:37:07

        20      requirements that derive from this.  And they           09:37:12

        21      derive originally from policy that is national          09:37:14

        22      policy, including authorization acts of 2005 and        09:37:16


                                                               36



         1      2008, that have focused our attention and               09:37:21

         2      designs to meet this.                                   09:37:26

         3                That includes a retirement of the             09:37:28

         4      Shuttle in 2010, reducing operations costs in           09:37:33

         5      order to be able to operate effectively and have        09:37:36

         6      a sustained program in the future, to develop           09:37:39

         7      the systems that we have in terms of building           09:37:42

         8      blocks for future exploration to Mars and               09:37:46

         9      beyond.                                                 09:37:50

        10                We have as a primary focus as a design        09:37:50

        11      factor safety.  This program was born out of the        09:37:55

        12      Columbia accident, and we have had a focus on           09:37:59

        13      loss of crew probabilities as we develop our            09:38:04


        14      systems.  And they have driven actually many of         09:38:08

        15      our component designs.                                  09:38:10

        16                We are to -- in our planning are to           09:38:12

        17      support the Space Station by 2015 and get to the        09:38:16

        18      Moon by 2020 with lunar missions.                       09:38:22

        19                A driving factor, Chris mentioned it          09:38:27

        20      earlier, separate crew from cargo.                      09:38:31

        21                And we also have to pay attention to          09:38:33

        22      our existing infrastructure and assets,                 09:38:35


                                                               37



         1      people/workforce, in terms of both NASA and the         09:38:38

         2      supplier base.  It's an important factor in all         09:38:43

         3      of this.                                                09:38:46

         4                Other factors that we have driven into        09:38:46

         5      the design are global lunar access, anytime             09:38:49

         6      return with the vehicles, use of the Space              09:38:56

         7      Station for exploration goals, which we do              09:39:00

         8      through our human research and technology               09:39:04

         9      programs as well as we will with the Orion, and         09:39:06

        10      to promote international and commercial                 09:39:11

        11      participation.                                          09:39:12

        12                We think all of this has to be looked         09:39:13

        13      at in terms of an integrated architecture.  If          09:39:15

        14      we can go to the next chart.                            09:39:15

        15                We've gone through a decision process         09:39:20

        16      to get to the vehicles that we have that are            09:39:24

        17      driven by this guidance, and I won't go through         09:39:24

        18      them step by step because I want to get to some         09:39:28

        19      of the other aspects of the program.                    09:39:31

        20                But basically we've gone through              09:39:33

        21      decision steps that have lead us to where we            09:39:33

        22      are.  The fact that we go beyond low Earth orbit        09:39:34


                                                               38



         1      has driven us to heavy lift to a -- to the              09:39:37

         2      physics drive you to a capsule-type design              09:39:39

         3      versus wings in terms of entry speeds and that          09:39:44

         4      sort of thing.  And also in terms of                    09:39:47

         5      understanding the transition of workforce and           09:39:49

         6      infrastructure facilities that were developed           09:39:52

         7      for Apollo and the space shuttle, it has                09:39:55

         8      affected the approach that we've taken, which is        09:40:01

         9      a shuttle drive design, the Ares I and Orion and        09:40:03

        10      Ares V.                                                 09:40:11

        11                And through that decision process we          09:40:11

        12      have looked for the opportunity to have synergy         09:40:14

        13      between these vehicles.  We do between solid            09:40:17

        14      rocket boosters, the J-2X upper stage engine,           09:40:20

        15      which is important to both, and other systems.          09:40:24

        16      We can go to the next chart.                            09:40:28

        17                And so as we assess this capability in        09:40:29


        18      our initial approaches to supporting the Space          09:40:31

        19      Station and the Moon, we also have assessed it          09:40:36

        20      with respect to Mars missions in terms of lift          09:40:39

        21      capability with a heavy lift and crew size with         09:40:43

        22      Orion, and it is capable as the basic                   09:40:47


                                                               39



         1      transportation infrastructure to support various        09:40:50

         2      destinations.  Next chart.                              09:40:51

         3                So an important factor -- I'll mention        09:40:56

         4      briefly -- is the transition of shuttle                 09:41:01

         5      capabilities.  We are making use of a                   09:41:03

         6      significant set of capabilities -- both                 09:41:06

         7      facilities, people and hardware -- at a number          09:41:07

         8      of locations.                                           09:41:10

         9                We have manufacturing capability that         09:41:14

        10      was developed for Apollo and is used by the             09:41:16

        11      external tank of the shuttle at Michoud.  That          09:41:19

        12      is one that we're going to use as we develop the        09:41:21

        13      upper stage and build structure for Orion.              09:41:25

        14                We have other capabilities -- we have         09:41:28

        15      the big capabilities you see at KSC with the VAB        09:41:31

        16      and the launch pads.                                    09:41:39

        17                And we have a significant supplier            09:41:39

        18      capability in the ATK with building solid               09:41:43

        19      rockets.                                                09:41:44

        20                We have Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne            09:41:44

        21      building liquid rockets for our human space             09:41:48

        22      flight vehicles.                                        09:41:51


                                                               40



         1                So there is a significant synergy, and        09:41:53

         2      actually it has been very important in trying to        09:41:56

         3      efficiently and effectively move from shuttle to        09:41:59

         4      station in terms of figuring out how to                 09:42:03

         5      transition all of this infrastructure.                  09:42:06


         6                And so it's important as we move              09:42:09

         7      across these boundaries in the retirement of the        09:42:11

         8      shuttle and in the flight of Ares I and Orion           09:42:16

         9      that we understand how we work through all of           09:42:20

        10      these capabilities that we have in the agency.          09:42:22

        11      So that is a part of our decision process and           09:42:26

        12      why we're on the path we're on.                         09:42:30

        13                And I would like to, now, turn it over        09:42:33

        14      to minutes, so Jeff will be getting ready.  We          09:42:36

        15      can go to next chart.                                   09:42:39

        16                I have two charts that show where the         09:42:40

        17      work is being done.  Currently we do have all of        09:42:43

        18      Ares I and Orion under contract.  We have civil         09:42:47

        19      servants with various responsibilities all over         09:42:49

        20      the agency.  We've spread out a number of the           09:42:53

        21      primary responsibilities.  All of the NASA              09:42:56

        22      centers are involved in this work.  Next chart.         09:42:59


                                                               41



         1                We also have, as I said, contractors          09:43:02

         2      in place that are working on all aspects of             09:43:04

         3      this, including now EVA -- the EVA suits, but           09:43:09

         4      located in places across the country supporting         09:43:14

         5      this program.                                           09:43:17

         6                And if Jeff would come up, I would            09:43:18

         7      like to hand it over to him to go through some          09:43:22

         8      of where we are in status and in our approach to        09:43:24

         9      this as well as address some of the issues and          09:43:28

        10      progress that we're making.                             09:43:30

        11                MR. HANLEY:  Thank you, Doug.                 09:43:36

        12                Good morning.  So I have a short movie        09:43:40

        13      to show you in just a minute to kind of really          09:43:43

        14      most efficiently express to you the progress            09:43:45

        15      over the last three years and where we're at.           09:43:48


        16                Before I get to that, though, I do            09:43:51

        17      want to touch on a couple of the issues that I          09:43:53

        18      know get discussed now and then in the                  09:43:58

        19      community, and I thought I'd update you on our          09:44:00

        20      progress on those.  So Next chart.                      09:44:03

        21                First, this is the key driving aspects        09:44:04

        22      of our lunar mission that we're designing to,           09:44:06


                                                               42



         1      and while many of these -- or all of these              09:44:10

         2      affect the solution for going to the Moon, a            09:44:13

         3      couple of them are most significant.  Global            09:44:16

         4      lunar access -- global surface access is really         09:44:20

         5      probably the main driver in what size is this           09:44:23

         6      architecture.                                           09:44:26

         7                But all of those parameters have been         09:44:28

         8      studied.  They've been parameterized.  We've            09:44:29

         9      done a significant amount of work to understand         09:44:33

        10      what this integrated architecture must do, as           09:44:36

        11      Doug was pointing out in his remark.  Next              09:44:39

        12      chart.                                                  09:44:39

        13                And we've looked beyond the Moon.             09:44:42

        14      We've gone and refreshed the Mars studies of the        09:44:44

        15      '90s for human missions to Mars and to refresh          09:44:47

        16      that looking at it from the standpoint of               09:44:50

        17      applying Constellation elements and making sure         09:44:52

        18      that the decisions that we're making today have         09:44:55

        19      a feed forward not just to the Moon but actually        09:44:58

        20      are building a capability that will eventually          09:45:02

        21      result in an ability to realize a human Mars            09:45:05

        22      mission.  Next chart.                                   09:45:08


                                                               43



         1                And we've looked at other applications        09:45:09

         2      of this hardware.  There's many possible things         09:45:12

         3      that one can do with this robust, heavy lift            09:45:15


         4      architecture that we're trying to foster with           09:45:19

         5      Constellation.                                          09:45:24

         6                We've got a capability to put cargo on        09:45:24

         7      board the Orion to be able to do missions other         09:45:28

         8      than just the crew support mission to the Space         09:45:29

         9      Station or to meet up with a lunar lander in low        09:45:33

        10      Earth orbit.                                            09:45:37

        11                We've looked at other applications of         09:45:37

        12      the -- us and others have looked at other               09:45:39

        13      applications of the Ares V lift capability.  Not        09:45:42

        14      only is it unprecedented in terms of the amount         09:45:44

        15      of mass it can lift to low Earth orbit but also         09:45:46

        16      the volume.  We've sized it so that                     09:45:50

        17      volumetrically it will be unprecedented.                09:45:52

        18                In this cartoon here in the lower             09:45:52

        19      right here, that's not a sophisticated                  09:45:57

        20      satellite.  That's several school buses that are        09:46:00

        21      stacked inside the Ares V shroud -- very                09:46:04

        22      significant capability.  Next chart.                    09:46:07


                                                               44



         1                And so here's a couple of the main            09:46:08

         2      issues that folks bring up every now and then or        09:46:10

         3      they hear about that I thought I'd give you the         09:46:15

         4      latest information on.                                  09:46:18

         5                First of all, as we've just pointed           09:46:20

         6      out, it's integrated architecture.  And so mass         09:46:21

         7      is one of the driving parameters, both the lift         09:46:25

         8      capability of the rockets and how much the              09:46:28

         9      elements that the rockets carry weigh, as you go        09:46:29

        10      through the entire life cycle of a mission from         09:46:33

        11      liftoff on the launch pad until the crew is             09:46:38

        12      recovered after landing.                                09:46:42

        13                And so here's where we're at today for        09:46:43


        14      the ISS mission for the amount of margin that           09:46:48

        15      we're currently carrying.                               09:46:50

        16                For Ares I, it has 22 percent lift            09:46:51

        17      capability margin, which is very good for where         09:46:55

        18      we're at today, which is just after PDR for the         09:46:59

        19      rocket.                                                 09:47:02

        20                The spacecraft is sitting at                  09:47:03

        21      23 percent mass margin for the ISS mission, and         09:47:06

        22      I am holding at my program level an additional          09:47:11


                                                               45



         1      5 percent margin on top of that.  We're doing           09:47:13

         2      very well for Block 1 of Orion and for Ares I.          09:47:16

         3                The lunar mission, still healthy              09:47:21

         4      margins, but probably the most driving one that         09:47:24

         5      you see there on the chart is the 10 percent for        09:47:26

         6      Orion.  We'll watch that very closely.  I've got        09:47:30

         7      that additional 4 percent in my pocket in the           09:47:34

         8      event that we need that.  But the rocket, again,        09:47:37

         9      Ares I, is doing very well to be able to lift           09:47:40

        10      the Orion to do both the lunar mission and the          09:47:44

        11      ISS mission.                                            09:47:47

        12                The limiting factor in this                   09:47:47

        13      architecture today in terms of the Orion's mass         09:47:48

        14      is its ability to land under the parachutes.            09:47:50

        15      The mass limit for the three big main parachutes        09:47:54

        16      is really the driving -- the parameter that             09:47:59

        17      sizes how heavy the Orion can be.  It is not the        09:48:02

        18      lift capacity of the rocket.                            09:48:08

        19                Another issue that gets talked about          09:48:09

        20      is what we call tower clearance or launch drift,        09:48:12

        21      and this received some notable mention a few            09:48:15

        22      months back.                                            09:48:20


                                                               46



         1                If one goes and looks at a video of           09:48:20


         2      the Saturn V lifting off launch pad during              09:48:25

         3      Apollo, watch it closely from the right vantage         09:48:28

         4      point and you'll watch that launch vehicle walk         09:48:31

         5      off of the pad away from the launch -- actually         09:48:32

         6      steer away from the launch tower.  And the              09:48:34

         7      Apollo crew members speak quite eloquently about        09:48:37

         8      what that sensation was like.                           09:48:41

         9                Well, this is no different in this            09:48:44

        10      case.  Every launch vehicle needs to assure its         09:48:46

        11      way as it takes off the launch pad.                     09:48:50

        12                We have one specific wind direction           09:48:50

        13      with a very stiff wind, near hurricane-force            09:48:51

        14      winds, where we would need to steer away --             09:48:55

        15      actually steer away from the launch tower, which        09:48:57

        16      we can easily do.  We have a design in place            09:49:00

        17      that could realize that.                                09:49:08

        18                We can also look at the -- at limiting        09:49:08

        19      the wind conditions for that one case, which            09:49:12

        20      would not be a significant impact at all to             09:49:15

        21      our -- what we call our launch availability, our        09:49:19

        22      probability of launching on any given day of the        09:49:23


                                                               47



         1      year at the Kennedy Space Center.                       09:49:26

         2                So that issue is, for all intents and         09:49:30

         3      purposes, really now just focused on how do we          09:49:32

         4      minimum plume damage to the launch tower as the         09:49:34

         5      vehicle flies away.                                     09:49:38

         6                For any rocket and spacecraft system          09:49:39

         7      one of the driving issues that designers deal           09:49:42

         8      with is induced environments.  That's the loads         09:49:46

         9      and the weather that you've got to fly through          09:49:50

        10      and the speeds at which the rocket is traveling         09:49:53

        11      and what that induces on both the rocket and its        09:49:57


        12      payload.                                                09:50:00

        13                And one of the conditions that gets           09:50:01

        14      talked about quite a bit is the phenomenon of           09:50:03

        15      thrust oscillation, and this is the phenomenon          09:50:08

        16      where for about a ten-second period in the              09:50:10

        17      130-second burn of the first stage -- for about         09:50:10

        18      a ten-second period the solid, which is really          09:50:12

        19      just a big tube, has a resonant frequency.  It's        09:50:15

        20      like an organ pipe.                                     09:50:20

        21                And so there can be conditions where          09:50:21

        22      for that five- to ten-second period it can              09:50:24


                                                               48



         1      resonate in a way that will vibrate not just            09:50:27

         2      solid motor but the entire vehicle if the               09:50:31

         3      vehicle is tuned up to it.                              09:50:34

         4                So we have taken active steps to              09:50:36

         5      mitigate that through putting in isolation              09:50:36

         6      planes between the solid and the second stage           09:50:39

         7      and between the second stage and the spacecraft         09:50:41

         8      in order to mitigate that, and we're moving             09:50:45

         9      forward with those designs.                             09:50:48

        10                And that design will give us not just         09:50:50

        11      a -- not just a -- for a single set of                  09:50:52

        12      conditions but for a range of conditions that           09:50:54

        13      could -- worse case conditions that could occur         09:50:57

        14      with that phenomenon.                                   09:50:59

        15                In addition to that, we are working --        09:51:01

        16      continue to work -- as every team of rocket             09:51:04

        17      designers does, we work on vibroacoustic loads,         09:51:07

        18      in other words, the sound levels both at liftoff        09:51:13

        19      and during flight.  The sound levels have been          09:51:16

        20      to accounted for in the design of the spacecraft        09:51:18

        21      and of the rocket and selection of the                  09:51:21


        22      components.  And that's all normal work for us.         09:51:23


                                                               49

         3      where we want to make a historical jump in the          09:51:30

         4      safety of the systems both for launch and in            09:51:34

         6      what we enjoy with the space shuttle today.  We         09:51:44

         7      believe that we are on a path to achieve that.          09:51:50

         8                The rocket and the spacecraft, from an        09:51:51

         9      abort capability perspective today, we're doing         09:51:54

        10      much better -- better than ten times what the           09:51:58

        11      statistical analyses of the shuttle suggests            09:52:00

        12      with respect to the ascent risk.                        09:52:05

        13                And over 60 vehicle design changes            09:52:08

        14      have been made.  And we've driven into                  09:52:10

        15      Constellation a risk-based design culture that          09:52:11

        16      looks at the probabilities of particular                09:52:13

        17      components failing, what their implications are         09:52:16

        18      to the mission and to the crew's safety, and we         09:52:19

        19      have made our selections in terms of                    09:52:22

         7      land that that is, in fact, a survivable event          09:52:54

         8      for the flight crew.                                    09:52:58

         9                Budgets continue to be a challenge.           09:53:01


        10      There have been many numbers floated out there          09:53:04

        11      as to what the total cost to initial operating          09:53:07

        12      capability is today.  We stand at $35 billion --        09:53:10

        13      that's with reserves -- to achieve the March of         09:53:11

        14      2015 goal, and that's with a confidence level in        09:53:15

        15      cost of 65 percent, in other words, two thirds          09:53:19

        16      chance that it will not cost any more than              09:53:22

        17      $35 billion.  That's really what all of that            09:53:25

        18      really means.                                           09:53:28

        19                We did have an original plan to spend,        09:53:29

        20      within the time frame of now through 2015, an           09:53:31

        15      looking at the entire breadth of content in the         09:54:22

        16      Constellation program to see if there's any             09:54:25

        17      economies that we can find, whether we can              09:54:26

        18      eliminate certain configurations.                       09:54:29

        19                And one of those -- one of those              09:54:31


        20      notable ones was the six versus four crew.  We          09:54:32

        21      eliminated that strictly to simplify the path to        09:54:36

        22      get to initial operating capability of March            09:54:40

         4                So here we'd like to show a little            09:54:51

         5      video if we could.  My hope is, of course, that         09:54:54

         6      the technology cooperates with us here.                 09:55:09

         7                (Whereupon, an informational video was        09:55:09

         9                NARRATOR:  It has been three short            09:55:37

        10      years NASA began a journey to create the next           09:55:38

        11      space program, one that would take us beyond            09:55:40

        12      Earth orbit, returning us to the Moon and               09:55:43

        13      extending our reach to Mars and beyond.                 09:55:47

        14                No longer just a program on paper,            09:55:47

        15      Constellation has projects, hardware and                09:55:52

        16      software in every stage of development.  In just        09:55:54

        17      three years, Constellation is ready for its             09:55:56

        18      first test flights, launching a new era of human        09:56:00

        19      space exploration.                                      09:56:05

        20                Through the Constellation program,            09:56:18

        21      NASA has taken a vision, the idea of exploring          09:56:21

        22      beyond low Earth orbit, and strategically               09:56:23

         1      created a detailed space architecture, a plan to        09:56:28

         2      make the vision a reality.  Constellation begins        09:56:31

         3      by conducting missions to the International             09:56:31

         4      Space Station, using the space laboratory as a          09:56:37

         5      destination and proving ground for a new                09:56:39

         6      generation of spacecraft.                               09:56:42

         7                Next Constellation sets its sights on         09:56:43


         8      the Moon, exploring the lunar surface in ways           09:56:47

         9      never before possible.                                  09:56:51

        10                Unlike Apollo which was limited to the        09:56:52

        11      exploration of the lunar equator,                       09:56:56

        12      Constellation's architecture will allow                 09:56:56

        13      astronauts to explore anywhere on the Moon,             09:56:58

        14      staying twice as long as the Apollo missions            09:57:02

        15      with twice as many crew members.  This extended         09:57:06

        16      exploration capability has been a driving force         09:57:09

        17      for all of the Constellation spacecraft designs,        09:57:09

        18      which will be able to lift more mass and travel         09:57:24

        19      farther than any previous spacecraft.                   09:57:24

        20                The Orion spacecraft is the crew              09:57:24

         1      from Apollo, saving time and design work as well        09:57:34

         2      as reducing risk.  However, the spacecraft is           09:57:37

         3      greater in size than Apollo, featuring updated          09:57:39

         4      computers, life support, electronics, heat              09:57:42

         8      articles have already been constructed and are          09:57:55

         9      being evaluated at NASA centers and engineering         09:57:56

        10      centers across the nation.                              09:58:00

        11                Parachute drops have been conducted to        09:58:02

         1      booster, similar to that used by the space              09:58:45

         2      shuttle, comprises the lower stage of Ares I.           09:58:49

         3      The upper stage features a J-2X liquid fuel             09:58:53

         4      rocket engine derived from an Apollo-era rocket         09:58:53

         5      engine.  Using these proven systems, the Ares I         09:59:00

         6      will get the crew into Earth orbit.                     09:59:01

         7                The Ares I project completed its              09:59:04

         8      preliminary design review, the first such               09:59:08

        11      called the Ares I-X is slated for launch in             09:59:18

        12      2009.  The test flight will be a major turning          09:59:23

        13      point in the program, providing essentially data        09:59:24

        14      on avionics, thrust vector control and other            09:59:26

         2      information possible on how the crew launch             09:59:59

         3      vehicle will perform.                                   10:00:02

         4                Ares V is the heavy lift cargo launch         10:00:04

         5      vehicle.  It will carry the lunar lander and            10:00:06


         6      other large components into space.  Again using         10:00:07

         7      legacy hardware, the Ares V will utilize solid          10:00:11

         8      rocket boosters during liftoff to help get the          10:00:15

         9      vehicle into orbit.                                     10:00:17

        10                The crew on board the Orion will              10:00:22

        11      rendezvous with an Earth departure stage of             10:00:22

        12      Ares V.  The entire stack -- Orion, the lunar           10:00:29

        13      lander and the Earth departure stage -- is then         10:00:34

        14      sent toward the Moon, once again, using the J-2X        10:00:37

        15      rocket motor.                                           10:00:42

        16                Because several key components of             10:00:42

        17      Ares V are the same as Ares I, much of the              10:00:44

        18      engineering work being done applies to both             10:00:47

        19      vehicles, from solid rocket booster tests to            10:00:49

        20      firings of the J-2X rocket engine, which is the         10:00:53

        21      first component to pass beyond the critical             10:00:57

         1                In all, the Ares V will be able to            10:01:02

         2      lift more mass than any previous spacecraft.            10:01:05

         3      Studies have already been conducted to see how          10:01:09

         4      this versatile craft could be used to launch            10:01:10

         7                The Altair lunar lander will carry            10:01:23

         8      four astronauts to the Moon.  Larger and more           10:01:27

         9      robust than its Apollo predecessor, Altair will         10:01:30

        10      be able to land anywhere on the lunar surface,          10:01:35

        11      even the lunar poles, previously an unreachable         10:01:35

        12      target by manned spacecraft.                            10:01:38

        15                Most importantly, the Constellation           10:02:45

        16      program is about people.  From around the               10:02:54

        17      nation, all NASA centers are engaged in this new        10:02:56

        18      exploration effort, problem solving, building,          10:03:00

        19      testing and taking on the challenges of human           10:03:03

        20      space exploration.  It is an effort that brings         10:03:08

        21      together generations, those who experienced the         10:03:11

        22      Apollo Moon landings and those who came after.          10:03:14

         1      Together they are working on a brighter future,         10:03:18

         2      looking to return to the Moon and go beyond.            10:03:21

         3                As the Constellation program leaps off        10:03:24


         4      of the drawing table onto the launch pad, a new         10:03:26

         5      chapter in exploration history is being written         10:03:30

         6      one milestone at a time.                                10:03:33

         7                (Whereupon, the video presentation            10:03:33

         8      concluded.)                                             09:32:56

         9                MR. COOKE:  Okay.  If we could just           09:32:56

        10      return to the charts briefly here --                    09:32:56

        11                MR. McALISTER:  Doug, we've got a hard        10:04:02

        12      cutoff with the --                                      10:04:05

        13                MR. COOKE:  Got you.                          09:32:56

        14                MR. McALISTER:  -- videoconference            10:04:05

        15      coming right up.                                        10:04:06

        16                MR. COOKE:  So with that, there's             09:32:56

        17      photographs in the back of additional hardware.         10:04:08

        18      And thank you for your time.                            10:04:10

        19                MR. McALISTER:  Thank you.                    10:04:02

        20                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Doug, thank you very          10:04:11

        21      much, and I think we've all got a lot of                10:04:13

        22      questions.  We won't have time to take them             10:04:16


                                                               60



         1      right now, but we'll have plenty of chance to           10:04:18

         2      work with you in the future.                            10:04:20

         3                What we want to do now is turn to             10:04:22

         4      another important aspect of the space program           10:04:24

         5      which concerns our efforts with our partner             10:04:27

         6      nations, and we have the opportunity this               10:04:30

         7      morning to visit with two of our partners,              10:04:33

         8      Mr. Dordain from ESA and General Perminov from          10:04:40

         9      RSA.  I believe they're together actually, and          10:04:45

        10      we will set up a link here so that we can visit         10:04:48

        11      with them.                                              10:04:52

        12                MR. McALISTER:  All right.  Well,             10:05:20

        13      we've hit our first glitch of the day.                  10:05:20


        14      Apparently the videoconference link has had a           10:05:23

        15      technical difficulty in Paris, which is where           10:05:26

        16      our international partners were going to link up        10:05:26

        17      with us, but we do think we could get it                10:05:29

        18      addressed in about ten minutes.                         10:05:29

        19                So we're going to take a ten-minute           10:05:31

        20      break and --                                            10:05:35

        21                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, wait a minute.          10:05:35

        22      Why don't we -- instead of taking a break this          10:05:36


                                                               61



         1      early, why don't we ask some questions --               10:05:39

         2                MR. McALISTER:  Oh, that's a great            10:05:44

         3      idea.                                                   10:05:46

         4                MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- of Doug here --            10:05:56

         5                MR. McALISTER:  Yeah.                         10:05:56

         6                MR. AUGUSTINE:  --  if you don't              10:05:56

         7      mind -- both of you.                                    10:05:56

         8                I'll start out with one while my              10:05:56

         9      colleagues are thinking, if that's all right.           10:05:59

        10                I was struck on the LOC calculations          10:06:02

        11      that on the shuttle that we know a lot about.           10:06:05

        12      You show a range of uncertainty by the factor of        10:06:09

        13      260 to 270, and yet for the Constellation it's          10:06:14

        14      one thousand two hundred -- or 2,850.                   10:06:20

        15                And I'm not trying to nitpick, but            10:06:22

        16      just the question is:  If we're so uncertain            10:06:25

        17      about today's system, how can we determine with         10:06:27

        18      certainty or anything approaching certainty --          10:06:31

        19                MR. COOKE:  Well, that's a great              10:06:35

        20      question.  And it's probably in the way that we         10:06:37

        21      chose to express it in the charts.                      10:06:40

        22                The number that we cite for                   10:06:42


                                                               62



         1      Orion/Ares I is the mean, and there is a                10=
:06:44

         2      distribution around that that would have a low          10:06:47

         3      and a high value.  It could be as low as a              10:06:49

         4      certain number and as high as a certain number.         10:06:53

         5      I don't have those numbers with me today.               10:06:56

         6                The way we use these numbers is really        10:06:58

         7      in comparison with alternatives in the design           10:07:01

         8      that we might choose for various systems.  The          10:07:04

         9      probability numbers are really informing the            10:07:07

        10      design.  And so as we do comparative analyses,          10:07:09

        11      really the absolute number is less important            10:07:16

        12      than -- as long as the analysis is done in              10:07:19

        13      comparing the alternatives in an                        10:07:22

        14      apples-to-apples way, that's where we would get         10:07:23

        15      the most value out of those numbers.                    10:07:26

        16                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you.  My                10:07:29

        17      colleagues -- one has got a question here.              10:07:29

        18                MR. COOKE:  We'll provide backup for          10:07:29

        19      that.                                                   10:07:29

        20                DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  And, In                  10:07:38

        21      particular, it would be interesting to look at          10:07:39

        22      what are usually called the P-5 and P-95, you           10:07:40


                                                               63



         1      know, the statistically significant lower and           10:07:43

         2      upper bounds of those numbers to get some               10:07:48

         3      insight as well.                                        10:07:48

         4                MR. COOKE:  Sure.                             10:07:50

         5                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Wanda...                      10:07:50

         6                DR. AUSTIN:  Yes.  You indicated you          10:07:51

         7      had a 65 percent confidence in the cost numbers.        10:07:53

         8                What's your confidence in the schedule        10:07:56

         9      of March 2015?                                          10:08:00

        10                MR. COOKE:  Right now the model that          10:08:01

        11      we have the most history with is the cost.              10:08:02


        12      We're actually developing a schedule model to           10:08:05

        13      get that type of calculation, and we're working         10:08:09

        14      through that with PA&E at headquarters to get to        10:08:11

        15      a point where we have a good schedule                   10:08:17

        16      calculation in terms of probability.                    10:08:20

        17                Our schedule, we are -- actually at           10:08:22

        18      this point we have moved from internal dates            10:08:27

        19      that we were planning for to our commitment date        10:08:33

        20      of March 2015.  So we're realigning our internal        10:08:36

        21      schedules right at this moment.  We know we have        10:08:42

        22      areas we need to work.  And so it's a tight             10:08:45


                                                               64



         1      schedule.  That's certain.                              10:08:48

         2                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Chris...                      10:08:52

         3                MR. CHYBA:  Thank you.                        10:08:54

         4                Your chart that you showed us on              10:08:54

         5      Influence of Key Drivers on Architecture                10:08:57

         6      Selection compared loss of crew probabilities           10:09:01

         7      for EELVs to Ares I and argued that it was              10:09:02

         8      really that distinction, if I understood the            10:09:08

         9      chart properly, that preferred Ares I to EELVs.         10:09:11

        10      You've just said in your remark that there's a          10:09:17

        11      range, of course, with respect to that estimate         10:09:19

        12      for loss of crew for Ares I.                            10:09:21

        13                Does that -- you know, does the one           10:09:23

        14      sigma in that extend over into the EELV range?          10:09:25

        15      Can you give us some sense of whether there's           10:09:29

        16      really a statistically significant difference           10:09:33

        17      between the two?                                        10:09:34

        18                MR. COOKE:  I think, in terms of the          10:09:35

        19      numbers that we showed you, the relative                10:09:37

        20      differences are important.  There are certainly         10:09:41

        21      probabilities associated with each one, and once        10:09:43


        22      again, I don't think we have those numbers here.        10:09:45


                                                               65



         1      But I think in the -- they were calculated in an        10:09:47

         2      apples-to-apples sense.                                 10:09:51

         3                MR. CHYBA:  But we will get those             10:09:54

         4      numbers?                                                10:09:54

         5                MR. COOKE:  Yeah.                             10:09:54

         6                MR. CHYBA:  Okay.  Thank you.                 10:09:56

         7                MR. COOKE:  We'll get you the                 10:09:57

         8      background on that.                                     10:09:58

         9                MR. HANLEY:  It's important to note,          10:09:59

        10      though, that the methodology used to assess all         10:10:02

        11      of the vehicle launch options was a common              10:10:04

        12      methodology.  That's what ESAS really was about.        10:10:07

        13      It was to take the synthesis of prior analysis          10:10:10

        14      and bring it apples to apples against a basic           10:10:13

        15      set of mission requirements and compare on a            10:10:18

        16      level playing field as best we could.                   10:10:23

        17                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Leroy...                      10:10:26

        18                MR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  I have a question          10:10:29

        19      about the Orion.  I know the nominal plan right         10:10:31

        20      now is to land in the water, but I noted in your        10:10:33

        21      charts that in a contingency you can land on            10:10:36

        22      terra firma.                                            10:10:36


                                                               66



         1                And if that's the case, I'm wondering         10:10:37

         2      why we don't o go back to that now.                     10:10:39

         3                MR. COOKE:  The reason is in a                10:10:42

         4      contingency sense we don't carry as much                10:10:44

         5      redundancy in the systems.  If we use at a              10:10:48

         6      primary mode of landing, we would have a lot            10:10:50

         7      more redundancy in it, and it would weigh a lot         10:10:53

         8      more.  And that's really the primary reason that        10:10:56

         9      we went to the water landing.  We wanted to make        10:10:59


        10      sure that we had the capability to land the crew        10:11:01

        11      without injury, but there's not the level of            10:11:04

        12      redundancy in systems to get to making that a           10:11:06

        13      nominal case.                                           10:11:15

        14                MR. CHIAO:  So even in the reduction          10:11:18

        15      of crew size from six to four, that's still the         10:11:18

        16      case?  I mean, you're still too heavy to land on        10:11:19

        17      land?                                                   10:11:20

        18                MR. COOKE:  Well, the thing is that we        10:11:20

        19      don't want to lose the capability associated            10:11:22

        20      with six crew.  So if we fill up that with              10:11:25

        21      weight, then you don't get to that point again.         10:11:31

        22                And also it's important in the time           10:11:33


                                                               67



         1      frame that we'll be traveling to the Space              10:11:35

         2      Station that we are able to carry up mass and           10:11:39

         3      down mass.  So we don't want to give up the             10:11:42

         4      mass -- any mass savings that you'd have there.         10:11:46

         5      We don't want to give all of that up to do -- to        10:11:49

         6      that capability or to get away from the original        10:11:52

         7      requirements.                                           10:11:54

         8                MR. McALISTER:  Mr. Chair, our link is        10:11:59

         9      back up with France.  Unfortunately we're only          10:12:00

        10      going to have audio, and we need to cut over            10:12:03

        11      right now.                                              10:12:07

        12                Sorry, Doug.                                  10:12:08

        13                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Jeff and Doug, thank          10:12:08

        14      very much.  We appreciate it.                           10:12:10

        15                Is the audio link live now?                   10:12:11

        16                MR. McALISTER:  Yeah.  Just go ahead          10:12:17

        17      and make the introduction, Mr. Chair.                   10:12:17

        18                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Fine.  This is         10:12:19

        19      Norm Augustine, and I'm here with my colleagues         10:12:22


        20      on our committee looking at the future of the           10:12:24

        21      U.S. Human Space Flight program.  We understand         10:12:25

        22      our video link is down but the audio link is            10:12:28

         1      working.                                                10:12:33

         2                We're very appreciative of your taking        10:12:34

         3      the time to speak with us.  I have already              10:12:37

         4      introduced you to the audience here in the room         10:12:40

         5      and on the television here in U.S.                      10:12:44

         6                But to both Mr. Dordain and General           10:12:47

         7      Perminov, as I say, we're very anxious to hear          10:12:49

         8      your thoughts on whatever it is you'd like to           10:12:51

         9      share with us, but a few things that I think            10:12:53

        10      we'd be particularly interested in would be what        10:12:56

        11      you see as...                                           10:12:59

        12                (Discussion off the record.)                  10:12:59

        13                GOVERNOR DORDAIN:  Okay.  Do you hear         10:13:42

        14      me?  Jean-Jacques speaking.  So can I start my          10:13:43

        15      remarks?                                                10:13:53

        16                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, thank you.  And         10:13:53

        17      let me just say a couple of things that we would        10:13:55

        18      be particularly interested in hearing and we'd          10:13:58

        19      welcome whatever you care to say to us.                 10:14:01

        20                We'd be very interested, I think, in          10:14:04

        21      your view of the utility of the ISS beyond 2016.        10:14:06

        22                We'd be, I think, also very interested        10:14:13


                                                               69



         1      in your thoughts of what international programs         10:14:16

         2      might go beyond the ISS into the future.                10:14:18

         3                We'd certainly welcome any comments           10:14:24

         4      you have on future international relationships          10:14:27

         5      and on some of the lessons we've learned from           10:14:30

         6      our partnerships to date.                               10:14:35

         7                So with that, let me turn to you and,         10:14:37


         8      again, thank you for sharing your thoughts with         10:14:39

         9      us.                                                     10:14:39

        10                GOVERNOR DORDAIN:  Okay.  Now, thank          10:14:41

        11      you from my side.  Thank you very much for              10:14:45

        12      giving me an opportunity to make a contribution         10:14:48

        13      to your committee.                                      10:14:53

        14                (Whereupon, Governor Dordain presented

        15      his comments via videoconference, and a

        16      typewritten version provided by Governor Dordain

        17      is included as follows:

        18                GOVERNOR DORDAIN:  This hearing is

        19      very timely, since for the first time in the

        20      history of the ISS, we have on board a crew of

        21      six made of five different nationalities -- the

        22      five partners are together in orbit, not only


                                                               70



         1      with hardware but also with astronauts living

         2      and working together in orbit, as we are working

         3      together on the ground since 20 years.

         4                This is just a fact which should

         5      inspire our reflections - there is not anymore,

         6      for any of the five partners, a separate Human

         7      Space Flight program.  We have all together

         8      one Human Space Flight program shared among five

         9      partners.  Obviously ESA cannot have a separate

        10      Human Space Flight program since we are

        11      dependent on the USA and on Russia for

        12      transporting our astronauts, but even though

        13      NASA and Roskosmos could have a separate

        14      program, they have not.

        15                And this is the reason why I am

        16      attaching a great importance to the hearing of

        17      today because your conclusions may have an

        18      impact on our own plans, but also, I hope, our

        19      inputs might have an impact on your conclusions.

        20                I thank Mike O'Brien to have sent me

        21      four questions of interest for you and I shall

        22      start by answering your questions, it being


                                                               71



         1      understood that I am ready to answer any

         2      further question you may raise, either today or

         3      at a later stage.

         4                I have not prepared a presentation of


         5      the European Space Agency, its programs and

         6      activities.

         7                However, I would like to underline

         8      three characteristics of ESA which could explain

         9      the common aspects of my answers and remarks of

        10      today:

        11                The European Space Agency has today 18

        12      Member States which, according to the

        13      ESA Convention, pool their resources for

        14      developing space systems for both science

        15      and applications to the citizens.  This means

        16      that the overall ESA activities range from

        17      Science of the Solar System and of the Universe,

        18      Science of the Earth and its environment, Life

        19      Sciences, Physical Sciences to operational

        20      meteorology, operational services for

        21      Environment and Security, operational navigation

        22      systems with Galileo, without forgetting the


                                                               72



         1      activities related to the guaranty of access to

         2      space and the development of competitive

         3      technologies, in particular for

         4      telecommunications.  As a result, human space

         5      flight activities in ESA represent a maximum of

         6      15% of the total ESA activities.  And Member

         7      States have never decided to increase their

         8      contribution to human space flight activities to

         9      the detriment of science and services to the

        10      citizens.

        11                This balance between different type of

        12      activities -- science, applications, innovation,

        13      launchers, human space flights is organized and

        14      even protected by the fact that there is

        15      not one ESA program and one ESA budget, but as

        16      many programs as type of activities.  And each

        17      development program is subject to one legal

        18      decision through which the Member States

        19      participating to that program are committed up

        20      to completion of that program (within the limit

        21      of 120% of the planned budget).  This

        22      process makes the decision difficult, but


                                                               73



         1      provides a robust basis to all individual

         2      programs of ESA once the decision is taken.

         3      This is the reason why ESA is the most reliable

         4      partner in the world.

         5                If there is one topic on which ESA can


         6      teach the worlds, it is about international

         7      cooperation.  International cooperation is our

         8      daily life:  18 countries of Europe

         9      cooperating within ESA and cooperating with all

        10      space powers in the world, starting

        11      with NASA which has been a partner since the

        12      start of the mother organization of

        13      ESA (ESRO born in 1964), with Canada which is

        14      not only an international partner but

        15      also associated to ESA, i.e., contributing to

        16      some ESA programs, with Russia, with

        17      Japan, with India, China... We know how much

        18      cooperation is difficult, but we know

        19      how much cooperation is successful.  It is

        20      always easier not to cooperate, but always

        21      more difficult to succeed alone.

        22                With this background, let's move on to


                                                               74



         1      your questions.

         2                1. What has ESA learned from the ISS

         3      partnership?

         4                The partnership is the most important

         5      asset of the ISS, which will live much longer

         6      than the hardware in orbit.

         7                The ISS partnership is an operational

         8      "G5" working everyday to reach common

         9      objectives.

        10                This is a very solid partnership

        11      because it has been built-up through a long list

        12      of problems (technical and financial) that we

        13      had to overcome together and even drama

        14      (the worst being the loss of Columbia) that we

        15      had to face together to reach a common

        16      objective -- completing the assembly of the ISS

        17      and maintaining a permanent human presence in

        18      orbit.

        19                ISS today is already a success, a

        20      technical, operational and management success, a

        21      fantastic success based on partnership.

        22                The first lesson of this partnership


                                                               75



         1      is the interest of keeping a partnership open to

         2      new partners -- the partnership has moved from

         3      the original four of Space Station Freedom

         4      to five in 1993, when the four partners:  USA,

         5      Canada, Japan and ESA sent a collective

         6      invitation to Russia for joining the

         7      partnership.  Fifteen years later, we know that,


         8      without Russia after the Columbia tragedy, the

         9      ISS would have collapsed.

        10                Now, and just because the partnership

        11      is so solid, we can and we have to draw

        12      together the lessons learned coming from our

        13      common experience onboard ISS, in particular, on

        14      what we could do better in future endeavors.  I

        15      was the one among the ISS Heads of Agencies to

        16      propose to share the lessons learned and the

        17      exercise is on-going.

        18                I would have preferred, therefore, to

        19      present today an already collective set of

        20      lessons learned, but I can tell you which points

        21      must, in my view, be investigated for

        22      improvements:


                                                               76



         1                a) Need for redundancy in key

         2      functions, in particular transportation

         3      functions.  The U.S. Space Shuttle has been a

         4      single point failure, in particular for

         5      transporting modules of ISS during the assembly

         6      phase and for downloading significant

         7      masses from the ISS to the ground.  When the

         8      Shuttle was grounded, all elements of ISS were

         9      grounded.  Interdependency should not mean,

        10      therefore, lack of redundancy.

        11                b) Need for full standardization --

        12      interdependency requires standardization of

        13      interfaces, which could not be fully achieved

        14      for ISS operation.

        15                c) Need for balancing utilization,

        16      assembly and maintenance activities from the

        17      start of the program.  The choice which has been

        18      made (which was maybe the only possible scenario

        19      after the Columbia tragedy), to concentrate all

        20      operations towards assembly, postponing

        21      therefore utilization after completion of

        22      assembly, has pushed the benefits very late in


                                                               77



         1      the program and created a gap with the user

         2      communities.

         3                d) The evolution of partnership from

         4      Freedom to ISS, as well as the sequence:

         5      assembly first, then utilization, has extended

         6      the program into a very long period, with no

         7      intermediate, concrete and visible, milestones

         8      which could have focused the teams on shorter


         9      term objectives and could have attracted the

        10      attention and interest of governments and

        11      public.  The only significant milestone is

        12      assembly complete which has moved continuously

        13      for a long time.

        14                e) The last improvement that we could

        15      bring for future endeavors is to associate the

        16      public from all partners to such programs.

        17                2. What is the European Space Agency's

        18      interest in continuing the ISS program and why?

        19                First of all, as I said above, the ISS

        20      program has been sequenced in two successive

        21      periods:  The assembly and then the utilization.

        22      The assembly is going to be completed next year,


                                                               78



         1      but the utilization is just starting.  The ISS

         2      is, therefore, already a technical success but

         3      is still far to be an overall success since the

         4      success of utilization is still to be

         5      demonstrated.  If the utilization is not a

         6      success, the overall ISS program will be

         7      assessed as a failure.

         8                There are, therefore, two basic

         9      reasons to continue the ISS program:

        10                1. To reap the benefits of the

        11      investments made, by utilizing the resources on

        12      board.  The ISS is a unique laboratory offering

        13      resources which cannot be found on Earth.  As

        14      for any laboratory, significant results will

        15      come from a repetition of experiments which

        16      require years rather than months.

        17                The costs of utilizing such laboratory

        18      are well defined and known by all partners.  The

        19      only answer to the question:  "How long should

        20      we use the ISS as a laboratory?"  Is:  "As long

        21      as the benefits are worth the costs."

        22                As far as the utilization of ISS is


                                                               79



         1      concerned, my proposal is therefore the

         2      following:  To organize every three years a

         3      joint (all partners) assessment of the

         4      benefits drawn from the utilization of ISS and

         5      to jointly decide on that basis to

         6      continue for another period of 4 to 5 years, up

         7      to the end of the technical duration

         8      of life of ISS.  This means that, if the


         9      benefits are worthwhile, new laboratories in

        10      LEO should be developed in order to keep the

        11      continuity of utilization beyond ISS.

        12                2. To be part of the human exploration

        13      program.  The ISS is the place for testing

        14      hardware and operations before they are used for

        15      lunar exploration and even more for Mars

        16      exploration which is the end objective of human

        17      exploration.  There should not be any gap

        18      between ISS operations and lunar operations,

        19      since any discontinuity would lead to a loss of

        20      expertise, because expertise is with the

        21      people who operate.

        22                As far as the role of ISS within the


                                                               80



         1      human exploration program is concerned, my

         2      proposal is therefore to continue the ISS

         3      operations up to the start of a human lunar base

         4      operation.

         5                In conclusion, there are two

         6      rationales for continuing the ISS program

         7      exploitation, one related to utilization, one

         8      related to human exploration, which may lead to

         9      two different dates for the end of exploitation.

        10      The best is, therefore, to define a rationale

        11      and not a date.

        12                3. How would you characterize the ESA

        13      obligation and that of the U.S. to the ISS in

        14      terms of its operational life?

        15                As I said above, it is more a question

        16      of rationale than a question of obligation:  If

        17      there is a common rationale to continue, it

        18      constitutes, in my view, an obligation to

        19      continue together.  On the other hand, no

        20      obligation can replace a lack of rationale.

        21                For what concerns each partner's

        22      obligations, they are defined in the


                                                               81



         1      multilateral IGA at Government level and in the

         2      bilateral MOU's at Agency level.

         3                First, the obligation of each partner

         4      is to maintain its own flight elements in order

         5      and to pay its share of common operations costs,

         6      i.e., for ESA to maintain the Columbus

         7      laboratory in order and to compensate for 8.3%

         8      of the common operation costs.  Against such

         9      obligation, each partner gets a right of


        10      utilization of a percentage of available

        11      resources proportional to its obligations.

        12      Second, there is no termination date in the

        13      different agreements, meaning that operational

        14      life continues if no decision is taken.  Third,

        15      each partner has the right to withdraw

        16      unilaterally at any time.  But there is a

        17      difference among partners:  If ESA withdrew, the

        18      other partners could continue on their own; if

        19      NASA withdrew, the ISS operations would stop,

        20      which makes a significant difference.

        21                However, I do not think that a

        22      unilateral decision could happen, first thanks


                                                               82



         1      to the solidity demonstrated in the partnership,

         2      second because the rationale is the same for

         3      all partners.  As I said above, the duration of

         4      operational life of ISS should rely on

         5      solid rationale and should be a joint decision

         6      by all partners.

         7                At the end, the only obligation of

         8      each Partner, is to match their budget with the

         9      objectives.  But this is true for any program,

        10      including non space programs.

        11                4. How does ISS and its extension past

        12      2015 connect to the European Space

        13      Agency's future plans for human and robotic

        14      exploration beyond low Earth

        15      orbit?

        16                The future plans of ESA for human and

        17      robotic exploration will be defined in several

        18      steps, the next step being planned in 2011.

        19                A first step has been defined in

        20      November 2008, with the decisions by Member

        21      States:

        22                To embark into an ambitious program of


                                                               83



         1      robotic exploration of Mars:  A first

         2      mission, Exomars, is under detailed definition,

         3      planning a launch in early 2016 with an

         4      objective for ESA to demonstrate landing, moving

         5      at the surface and drilling capabilities.

         6      Follow-on missions are being prepared.  These

         7      missions are subject to a lot of discussions

         8      with NASA for a long term cooperation, starting

         9      by a significant contribution of NASA to

        10      Exomars, based on the model of our common


        11      success Cassini Huygens.  Discussions with

        12      Russia are also on-going, including an ESA

        13      contribution to the Russian Phobos Grunt

        14      mission.

        15                To start the preparation of a

        16      potential contribution of ESA to a human lunar

        17      exploration programs.  It is clear that for

        18      human exploration:

        19                Europe is dependent upon other

        20      partners, in particular, USA, and cannot take

        21      decisions on its own.

        22                Europe needs a high level political


                                                               84



         1      decision, because any significant contribution

         2      of Europe to human exploration requires

         3      significant additional budget, since human

         4      exploration should not be developed to the

         5      detriment of science and applications for the

         6      citizens.  A first high level political

         7      conference on the subject is planned in October

         8      this year.

         9                At the end, the most important

        10      connection between ISS duration of life and

        11      future human exploration is the budget

        12      competition:  Can we afford to finance ISS

        13      continuation and the development of future human

        14      exploration?

        15                This is the reason why, one important

        16      rationale to continue ISS is to make it an

        17      integral part of the exploration program.

        18                This the reason why also, additional

        19      resources are necessary because you can always

        20      transfer budgets between operations and

        21      development activities, but you cannot transfer

        22      the expertise because operations require very


                                                               85



         1      different industrial capabilities than

         2      development.

         3                Before closing my statement, Mister

         4      Chairman, I would like to come back to a

         5      very important characteristic for a partnership

         6      to be sustainable -- it must be open to new

         7      partners.  And we, the five partner of the ISS,

         8      we must address an important question -- shall

         9      we invite other partners, China, India, South

        10      Korea (which are today contributing to the

        11      elaboration of a Global Exploration Strategy) to

        12      join our current partnership, under "terms and


        13      conditions" that we could jointly agree (as we

        14      have done in 1993 when inviting Russia to join

        15      the four Freedom partners)?

        16                I do not want to anticipate the

        17      answer, but not raising the question among the

        18      five partners would be, in my view, the worst

        19      option.

        20                You will receive soon a typed version

        21      of my remarks and I thank you for your

        20      is with you.                                            10:52:36

        21                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Good.  Well, thank you        10:52:36

        22      very much for being with us.  We have a large           10:52:38


                                                               87



         1      group here in Washington and a group on                 10:52:42

         2      television -- public television -- or available         10:52:45

         3      to the public, and we would be very interested          10:52:48


         4      in your thoughts on the subject of international        10:52:52

         5      programs, the long-term future of ISS, programs         10:52:56

         6      beyond that and anything you would care to share        10:53:01

         7      with us.  We have allotted about 20 more minutes        10:53:04

         8      for this session, and so if you could make any          10:53:07

         9      comments, we'd be very appreciative.                    10:53:12

        10                I'm afraid our communications have            10:53:50

        11      broken down.  We may have to reschedule this for        10:53:52

        12      another time.                                           10:53:56

        13                General, are you able to hear me?             10:53:57

        14                (Discussion off the record.)

        15                GENERAL PERMINOV:  Now, the view of

        16      Roscosmos NASA Current Plan For Human Space

        17      Flight.

        18                (Whereupon, General Perminov presented

        19      his comments via videoconference with the

        20      assistance of an interpreter, and a typewritten

        21      version provided by General Perminov is included

        22      as follows:


                                                               88



         1                GENERAL PERMINOV:  Critical to the ISS

         2      program implementation are the issues of

         3      technical and transportation support (crew

         4      rotation, crew rescue, cargo delivery, etc.).

         5                Roscosmos welcomes NASA endeavor to

         6      speed up the development of the new piloted

         7      transportation system "Orion" and the new launch

         8      vehicle "Ares I".

         9                Successful implementation of

        10      Commercial Orbital Transportation Services for

        11      the ISS would allow to streamline technical and

        12      transportation support of the station and to

        13      make it more systematic and stable.

        14                NASA Human Space Flight program looks

        15      quite balanced and promising to us.

        16                2. Cooperation with NASA in ISS

        17      Program:

        18                Roscosmos-NASA cooperation over recent

        19      years has provided the following results:

        20                After Columbia accident in 2003 the

        21      permanent crew presence on the ISS was ensured

        22      and maintained;


                                                               89



         1                The ISS international crews rotation

         2      has been conducted including rescue capability

         3      in case of contingency situations; the ISS cargo

         4      delivery and utilization has been ensured taking

         5      into account the planned Space Shuttle

         6      retirement in 2010;

         7                ISS U.S. Segment deployment has been

         8      completed;

         9                The launch of Soyuz TMA in May 2009

        10      increased the ISS crew up to six persons.

        11                Cooperation experience accumulated by

        12      Roscosmos and NASA allows us to proceed to the

        13      next stage of ISS utilization:  A full-scale

        14      implementation of the national programs of

        15      scientific experiments in space and ISS

        16      utilization as an international space

        17      laboratory.

        18                2. Cooperation with NASA in ISS

        19      Program:

        20                Roscosmos-NASA cooperation over recent

        21      years has provided the following results:

        22                After Columbia accident in 2003 the


                                                               90



         1      permanent crew presence on the ISS was ensured

         2      and maintained;

         3                The ISS international crews rotation

         4      has been conducted including rescue capability

         5      in case of contingency situations; the ISS cargo

         6      delivery and utilization has been ensured taking

         7      into account the planned Space Shuttle

         8      retirement in 2010;

         9                ISS U.S. Segment deployment has been

        10      completed;

        11                The launch of Soyuz TMA in May 2009

        12      increased the ISS crew up to six persons.

        13                Cooperation experience accumulated by

        14      Roscosmos and NASA allows us to proceed to the

        15      next stage of ISS utilization:  A full-scale

        16      implementation of the national programs of

        17      scientific experiments in space and ISS

        18      utilization as an international space

        19      laboratory.

        20                3. Desirability of ISS Operation

        21      Beyond 2016:

        22                Completion of the ISS U.S. segment


                                                               91



         1      deployment as well as Roscosmos plans to

         2      additionally equip the ISS Russian segment in

         3      the nearest future will significantly increase

         4      the ISS scientific potential.


         5                By 2015 the ISS will have the unique

         6      capabilities for scientific research in space,

         7      engineering development and implementation of

         8      humanitarian, educational and commercial

         9      projects.

        10                Taking into account these

        11      circumstances, as well as recommendations

        12      approved at June 2008 meeting of Heads of

        13      Agencies Roscosmos considers it expedient to

        14      prolong the ISS utilization term up to 2020 at

        15      the minimum.

        16                4. Russia Future Plans For Human Space

        17      Flight Program:

        18                The prospective plans for the Russian

        19      human space flight are determined by the Federal

        20      Space Program of Russia for the period from 2006

        21      to 2015, the Concept of Russian Human Space

        22      Flight Development till 2020 and a number of


                                                               92



         1      other documents.

         2                The main objectives of the future

         3      human space flights are:

         4                Exploration and efficient utilization

         5      of the near Earth space;

         6                Study and exploration of the Moon,

         7      Mars and deep space in order to resolve global

         8      problems on the Earth and in space and to

         9      generate new knowledge for the benefit of the

        10      humankind.

        11                In order to achieve the above

        12      mentioned goals we expect to make the following

        13      steps in the timeframe until 2020:

        14                Complete the assembly of the ISS

        15      Russian Segment and to continue its utilization

        16      in full configuration;

        17                Provide the creation of the

        18      prospective crew transportation system based on

        19      a new generation piloted spacecraft;

        20                Build and prepare for operation the

        21      first elements of the orbital assembly

        22      experimental piloted space complex by the end


                                                               93



         1      the ISS life cycle;

         2                Develop elements, technologies and key

         3      systems of prospective interplanetary complexes

         4      for missions to the Moon and Mars, and develop

         5      new means and methods of biomedical support to

         6      ensure long-term human space flights, including

         7      the interplanetary flights, and so on.


         8                5. Future Interaction With NASA In

         9      Space Exploration:

        10                The experience gained by Russia, U.S.

        11      and Europe in the area of piloted space

        12      complexes and their long-term utilization,

        13      including the ISS activities, allows us to

        14      proceed to the implementation of the

        15      larger-scale projects, in particular, the

        16      development of piloted spacecraft for missions

        17      to the Moon and Mars.

        18                Roscosmos supports the necessity of

        19      involving technical and scientific potential of

        20      other countries for such large-scale projects

        21      implementation.

        22                Russia finds acceptable those projects


                                                               94



         1      which ensure equal rights of partners who will

         2      share the obtained results and also Russia's

         3      participation in the development of critical

         4      elements (launch vehicles, power propulsion

         5      systems, technologies and experience of

         6      long-term crew life support in space).

         7                In this connection Roscosmos considers

         8      it expedient to establish the international

         9      joint expert group to conduct comprehensive

        10      analysis of integration feasibility in the

        11      sphere of space exploration.

        12                6. What has Roscosmos learned from the

        13      ISS partnership?

        14                Apparently, the ISS lessons show that

        15      any critical element in the project should have

        16      a backup (should be redundant).  As a rule, such

        17      elements include launch vehicles, crew and cargo

        18      transportation spacecraft and Mission Control

        19      Centers.

        20                During the utilization phase the

        21      redundancy should be provided by various modules

        22      and project elements for the specific functions


                                                               95



         1      such as habitation, power supply and, partly,

         2      the payload complexes and systems.

         3                The ISS could serve as a unique test

         4      stand for developing advanced technologies.

         5      This process has already started and will expand

         6      as we accumulate more experience and

         7      capabilities for autonomous stay on the ISS.

         8                The ISS lessons show that educational


         9      and public outreach activities are very

        10      important for attracting the young people's

        11      interest to space.

        12                The ISS international management

        13      structure has already demonstrated its success.

        14      It would make sense to apply this experience to

        15      other big international projects.

        16                7. How would you characterize the

        17      Russian obligations and that of the U.S. to the

        18      ISS in terms of its operational life?

        19                The main tasks of Russia and the U.S.

        20      at this point are as follows:

        21                Maintenance of operation of the ISS

        22      Russian and U.S. Segments for implementation of


                                                               96



         1      the national programs of space experiments and

         2      research;

         3                Fulfillment of mutual obligations

         4      under existing international arrangements;

         5                Maintenance of ground infrastructure

         6      for the ISS nominal operation;

         7                Transportation and technical provision

         8      of the ISS according to the agreements achieved

         9      with NASA in view of the Shuttle retirement in

        10      2010;

        11                Participation in managing the ISS

        12      program (the ISS coordination boards and

        13      groups);

        14                Provision of the ISS efficient

        15      utilization.

        16                We believe that the Unites States, as

        17      the main coordinator of the project, will

        18      promote stable and planned implementation of the

        19      ISS program, including the transportation and

        20      technical provision of the station, the required

        21      conditions for the crew presence onboard,

        22      improvement of the station control structure,


                                                               97



         1      etc.

         2                8. How does ISS and its extension past

         3      2015 connect to Russia's future plans for human

         4      and robotic exploration beyond low-Earth orbit?

         5                By the end of the ISS life cycle

         6      Roscosmos plans to develop and prepare for

         7      operation the first elements of the orbital

         8      assembly experimental piloted space complex

         9      which will become a basis for engineering

        10      development for future human missions to Mars

        11      beyond 2030.


        12                It is impossible to create such a

        13      complex without a preliminary testing of its

        14      elements in space and verification of

        15      engineering solutions and technologies.

        16                The ISS operation experience

        17      demonstrates that the station utilization allows

        18      to solve the unique tasks of extending the life

        19      of both the station elements and the automatic

        20      space instruments (space telescopes, etc) in

        21      autonomous flight.  This adds another good

        22      argument in favor of the ISS program extension

         1      till 2020 and beyond.                                   10:50:36

         2                (Whereupon, the typewritten version of        10:50:36

         3      General Perminov's comments concluded.)                 10:50:36

         4                GENERAL PERMINOV:  Thank you very much        10:50:36

         5      for your attention.                                     11:12:54

         6                MR. McALISTER:  Thank you,                    11:12:54

         7      Mr. Perminov.  Our chairman had to step out for         11:12:56

         8      a moment.  So we have a couple of minutes until         11:12:59

         9      our next presentation.  We're making a few              11:13:02

        10      adjustments on the fly.                                 11:13:05

        11                But for now, if any of the committee          11:13:07

        12      members have any questions for Mr. Perminov or          11:13:09

        13      Mr. Dordain, if he is still there, now is the           11:13:13

        14      time.                                                   11:13:17

        15                And we also have our head of                  11:13:17

        16      international relations at NASA Mike O'Brien --         11:13:18

        17      I think I saw him in the audience.  So if we            11:13:19

        18      have any questions for Mike, he can address             11:13:22

        19      those now as well.                                      11:13:25

        20                We are just waiting on                        11:13:26

        21      Representative Hall who is at Mass and Third,           11:13:29

        22      I'm told, on his way.                                   11:13:32


                                                               99



         1                So for the committee members, any             11:13:34

         2      questions for -- okay.                                  11:13:36


         3                Oh, go ahead, Chris.                          11:13:40

         4                MR. CHYBA:  Mr. Perminov, could you           11:13:45

         5      tell us a bit more about how experience using           11:13:47

         6      the station in orbital construction is or is not        11:13:51

         7      crucial to your plans for the orbital assembly          11:13:57

         8      of the space complex?                                   11:13:59

         9                GENERAL PERMINOV:  I would like to            11:15:16

        10      note that the program over developing the newer         11:15:17

        11      crew transportation vehicle is linked to the            11:15:20

        12      International Space Station program, and their          11:15:25

        13      link is mostly financial, because we will design        11:15:28

        14      the new space transportation vehicle taking into        11:15:32

        15      account all our obligations out of the ISS              11:15:36

        16      program.                                                11:15:39

        17                (Discussion off the record.)                  11:15:51

        18                MR. McALISTER:  The question is -- is         11:15:51

        19      Jean-Jacques Dordain still with us, because we          11:15:55

        20      have a question for him?                                11:16:00

        21                GOVERNOR DORDAIN:  Yes.  Go ahead.  I         11:16:02

        22      am here.                                                11:16:10


                                                              100



         1                DR. CRAWLEY:  Mr. Dordain, this is Ed         11:16:18

         2      Crawley, a member of the panel.  I was very             11:16:21

         3      interested in your comments about the need to           11:16:24

         4      consider utilization of space assets and their          11:16:26

         5      development in parallel.  Of course, you made           11:16:30

         6      this comment with respect to the development of         11:16:33

         7      the ISS.                                                11:16:37

         8                But I wonder if you could comment a           11:16:39

         9      little bit more in general about how you might          11:16:41

        10      see developments going forward in such a way            11:16:46

        11      that they did not rely on a long period of              11:16:50

        12      development before a period of utilization.             11:16:55


        13                GOVERNOR DORDAIN:  What I said is --          11:17:01

        14      again, the lessons learned coming from the ISS,         11:17:05

        15      yes, as I said, pushing back the utilization at         11:17:08

        16      the end of something complete is a problem, and         11:17:15

        17      that's been a problem to keep the attractiveness        11:17:16

        18      of the Space Station to the user communities.           11:17:23

        19      In my view, if we could have done -- but, again,        11:17:27

        20      as I said, the scenario which has been chosen           11:17:29

        21      is -- has been chosen after the Columbia                11:17:36

        22      tragedy, and taking into account the resected           11:17:39


                                                              101



         1      number of federal flags that are left, maybe it         11:17:43

         2      was not possible to do differently.                     11:17:47

         3                But in an ideal case where we could           11:17:49

         4      have selected an optimal sequence, in my view,          11:17:54

         5      we should have chosen to -- a scenario where we         11:18:02

         6      could have started utilization of the Space             11:18:06

         7      Station much earlier, taking benefit of the             11:18:13

         8      first laboratories which have been launched, and        11:18:15

         9      that would have required separate launches              11:18:19

        10      dedicated to utilization before launches                11:18:26

        11      dedicated to assembly.  And that was not                11:18:29

        12      possible.  So this is the lessons learned from          11:18:32

        13      the Space Station.                                      11:18:34

        14                Now, for any future endeavor,                 11:18:35

        15      including now exploration, our interest is to           11:18:38

        16      make sure that we shall not spend 10 to 15 years        11:18:44

        17      just to build the infrastructure and to tell the        11:18:49

        18      users -- in part, you know, the scientists --           11:18:53

        19      that they have to wait for 15 years before              11:18:57

        20      having a chance to use that infrastructure.             11:19:01

        21                So we have to have a plan which, as I         11:19:04

        22      said, should include much softer milestone and          11:19:06


                                                              102




         1      include also a utilization program at the               11:19:15

         2      very -- at the earliest stage of the development        11:19:18

         3      of a lunar base.                                        11:19:22

         4                So, now, it may be simple to be said          11:19:23

         5      and maybe more difficult to be accommodated.  I         11:19:29

         6      think that the five partners should work                11:19:36

         7      together to make sure that we are able to               11:19:37

         8      associate the user communities as early as              11:19:41

         9      possible in the development of a new lunar base         11:19:45

        10      or whatever endeavor that we are making                 11:19:49

        11      together.                                               11:19:52

        12                DR. CRAWLEY:  Thank you.                      11:19:56

        13                MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think we should not         11:19:58

        14      impose anymore on your time, but on behalf of           11:20:00

        15      those of us here in America, let us thank both          11:20:03

        16      of you for your willingness to share your               11:20:10

        17      thoughts with us.                                       11:20:12

        18                We look forward to having an                  11:20:12

        19      opportunity to visit with you again as we get           11:20:14

        20      further into our work.  And should you have             11:20:17

        21      anything additional that either of you would            11:20:20

        22      like us to be aware of, we would certainly              11:20:22

         1      welcome any contact.                                    11:20:25

         2                So, again, thank you very much, and we        11:20:26

         3      hope you have a very nice day, both of you.             11:20:28

         4                GENERAL PERMINOV:  Thank you.                 11:20:32

         5                GOVERNOR DORDAIN:  Thank you very             11:20:33

         6      much.  And, again, we are at your disposal for          11:20:34

         7      anything that you would like to get from us.  At        11:20:38

         8      least I am speaking as ESA, but I am sure that          11:20:42

         9      Mr. Perminov will say the same.                         11:20:44

        10                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Very good.  Well,             11:20:48


        11      thank you.                                              11:20:50

        12                MR. McALISTER:  Mr. Chair, a couple of        11:20:54

        13      quick comments.                                         11:20:55

        14                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sure.                         11:20:56

        15                MR. McALISTER:  As I said, we're              11:20:58

        16      moving things around a little bit on the fly.           11:20:59

        17      We all know the cliche that rocket science is           11:20:59

        18      hard.  Well, running a meeting on rocket science        11:21:03

        19      is also hard.  We've hit our first glitch --            11:21:05

        20                MR. AUGUSTINE:  I could note that we          11:21:08

        21      get images from Mars quite well.                        11:21:10

        22                MR. McALISTER:  Yeah.  Good point.            11:21:10

         1                MR. AUGUSTINE:  But I won't.                  11:21:12

         2                MR. McALISTER:  With respect to the           11:21:14

         3      congressional hour, the leadership of the NASA          11:21:16

         4      authorization committees were invited to address        11:21:19

         5      the panel and/or submit information related to          11:21:22

         6      the human space flight provisions of the NASA           11:21:25

         7      Authorization Acts of 2004 and 2008.                    11:21:29

         8      Unfortunately due to the press of congressional         11:21:32

         9      business, a number of the members were unable to        11:21:36

        10      appear in person.                                       11:21:39

        11                The panel would like to acknowledge           11:21:40

        12      that the following members will be submitting           11:21:41

        13      statements to the Committee for their                   11:21:41

        14      consideration:  Congressman Bart Gordon,                11:21:43

        15      chairman of the House Science and Technology            11:21:46

        16      Committee; Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, ranking        11:21:48

        17      member of the Senate Commerce, Science and              11:21:52

        18      Technology Committee; and Senator David Vitter,         11:21:53

        19      ranking member of the Senate Science and Space          11:21:56

        20      Subcommittee.                                           11:22:00


        21                In addition, Congressman Hall, the            11:22:02

        22      ranking member of the House Science and                 11:22:05


                                                              105



         1      Technology Committee, has submitted a statement         11:22:07

         2      that's going to be read by the Congressman Pete         11:22:09

         3      Olson, the ranking member of the House Space and        11:22:11

         4      Aeronautics Committee.  So we welcome                   11:22:13

         5      Representative Hall, and we're ready for his            11:22:16

         6      presentation.                                           11:22:18

         7                And then following Representative             11:22:20

         8      Hall's statement, we are expecting Senator Bill         11:22:21

         9      Nelson, chairman of the Senate Science and Space        11:22:23

        10      Subcommittee, to also address the panel at              11:22:24

        11      approximately 11:45.                                    11:22:27

        12                So amazingly we're kind of back on            11:22:29

        13      schedule.                                               11:22:32

        14                So Representative Olson...                    11:22:33

        15                CONGRESSMAN OLSON:  Well, thank you           11:22:40

        16      very much.  It's a tremendous honor and an              11:22:42

        17      opportunity to speak before you.  And just to           11:22:46

        18      show you, we're going to throw you another              11:22:46

        19      little curve ball.  Ken Monroe from                     11:22:49

        20      Congressman Ralph Hall's staff is going to read         11:22:50

        21      his statement, and I'm going to give a very             11:22:52

        22      brief statement myself.                                 11:22:55


                                                              106



         1                But thank y'all for coming today.             11:22:57

         2      Mr. Augustine and Members of the Review Panel,          11:23:00

         3      thank you for the opportunity to speak today.           11:23:00

         4                I was pleased when the Administration         11:23:02

         5      announced the members of this panel.  It's an           11:23:04

         6      incredibly, incredibly successful and                   11:23:07

         7      well-respected panel, and we look forward to            11:23:10

         8      your work.  You all bring different expertise to        11:23:13


         9      the task, and I look forward to working with you        11:23:17

        10      during your review as well as afterwards in             11:23:20

        11      response to your recommendations.                       11:23:20

        12                As I'm sure you're aware, your work is        11:23:21

        13      being closely watched within the space                  11:23:24

        14      community, in the media and, particularly where         11:23:28

        15      I work, on Capitol Hill.                                11:23:31

        16                NASA and Human Space Flight have              11:23:33

        17      bipartisan support on the Hill, but                     11:23:36

        18      unfortunately too many of my colleagues are             11:23:37

        19      unfamiliar with the challenges facing our Human         11:23:37

        20      Space Flight program.  Members and staff are            11:23:42

        21      going to give tremendous weight to your findings        11:23:44

        22      with respect to the future that NASA should be          11:23:47

         1      taking.  I know you take this responsibility            11:23:50

         2      seriously, and I know you understand the                11:23:53

         3      influence your review will wield.                       11:23:55

         4                I understand you'll be headed to              11:23:58

         5      Houston, the Johnson Space Center, in late July,        11:24:01

         6      and I look forward to welcoming you.  The               11:24:03

         7      Johnson Space Center is the lead space center,          11:24:06

         8      as you know, for Constellation.  The                    11:24:09

         9      Constellation systems and the Ares V heavy-lift         11:24:09

        10      launch vehicle holds the promise of returning           11:24:14

        11      America to exploring the Moon.                          11:24:16

        12                The Congress has endorsed that plan           11:24:18

        13      since 2005, and NASA has had a remarkably stable        11:24:20

        14      direction for the last several years.  Our              11:24:26

        15      problem has not been a lack of vision.  It's            11:24:28

        16      been a lack of commitment.                              11:24:31

        17                I'm proud to represent Texas, but my          11:24:33

        18      concerns are not limited to my home state.  The         11:24:36


        19      United States is the global leader in aerospace.        11:24:38

        20      Aerospace is one of our most successful export          11:24:41

        21      markets and the driver of much of our new               11:24:46

        22      technology.                                             11:24:49


                                                              108



         1                For the past six months that I've been        11:24:50

         2      in Congress, we have decried the loss of                11:24:53

         3      prestigious industries that were once dominated         11:24:55

         4      by American companies.  I believe it's good             11:24:58

         5      policy to foster the creation of good paying            11:25:01

         6      jobs, and we have worked to establish                   11:25:04

         7      educational initiatives to promote a technical          11:25:07

         8      and highly skilled workforce.  Human space              11:25:09

         9      flight provides all of those things.                    11:25:13

        10                Y'all know this.  And I hope that             11:25:15

        11      these points will be reiterated in your                 11:25:18

        12      findings.                                               11:25:22

        13                Most of us who follow the space               11:25:23

        14      program know the impending problems.  But there         11:25:26

        15      are other members of mine on Capitol Hill who           11:25:29

        16      will soon be asking why we don't have our own           11:25:31

        17      independent access to the Space Station that's          11:25:34

        18      been primarily funded by the American taxpayer.         11:25:36

        19      The American public will ask why are we paying          11:25:41

        20      the Russians as much as $50 million to take our         11:25:41

        21      astronauts to the Space Station.  Others will           11:25:45

        22      ask why we didn't accelerate the development of         11:25:48


                                                              109



         1      Constellation to narrow the gap following the           11:25:50

         2      retirement of the space shuttle.                        11:25:50

         3                And as we all know, the gap will be           11:25:54

         4      very damaging to our aerospace workforce.  The          11:25:57

         5      job losses are real, and they are jobs we're not        11:26:00

         6      going to easily get back.  As our economy               11:26:04


         7      struggles to rebound, this kind of job loss will        11:26:07

         8      not be ignored.  It should not happen under any         11:26:11

         9      circumstance, but I'm just reiterating the              11:26:14

        10      context of the work you're undertaking.                 11:26:15

        11                NASA and our Human Space Flight               11:26:18

        12      program, as we all know, we're at one of the            11:26:22

        13      crossroads.                                             11:26:23

        14                In 1962 before I was born, John F.            11:26:25

        15      Kennedy stood on the football stadium at my             11:26:29

        16      alma mater, Rice University, and we were at one         11:26:32

        17      of those crossroads there and he gave us                11:26:34

        18      direction, that we'd go back to the Moon -- or          11:26:36

        19      we'd go to the Moon by the end of the decade.           11:26:39

        20                We faced another time in the late             11:26:42

        21      '60s, early '70s when we were trying to figure          11:26:44

        22      out what we were going to do after the Apollo           11:26:46


                                                              110



         1      missions, and President Nixon put us on a course        11:26:51

         2      to develop the space shuttle, which led to the          11:26:53

         3      Space Station.                                          11:26:54

         4                And now we're at another such time.           11:26:55

         5      No entity in this whole debate is going to have         11:26:58

         6      a bigger say than this commission.                      11:27:03

         7                I wish this panel the best, and I look        11:27:05

         8      forward to working with you.  If there's                11:27:08

         9      anything I can do to help, please let me know,          11:27:10

        10      because we must maintain our preeminence as the         11:27:12

        11      leader in human space flight.                           11:27:15

        12                And I thank you, again, for the               11:27:18

        13      opportunity to speak with you and, again, wish          11:27:19

        14      you well and look forward to seeing you down in         11:27:22

        15      Houston.  Thank you.                                    11:27:24

        16                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, thank you very          11:27:26


        17      much and thanks for your leadership on this             11:27:27

        18      whole topic and I've appreciated the chances            11:27:29

        19      we've had to speak in the past about this.  So          11:27:32

        20      we will be doing our best.                              11:27:35

        21                CONGRESSMAN OLSON:  Yes, sir.  Balls          11:27:39

        22      and strikes.  We'll take care of the politics.          11:27:41


                                                              111



         1                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Thank you.             11:27:43

         2      Very good.                                              11:27:45

         3                MR. MONROE:  Mr. Hall regrets that he         11:27:50

         4      was not able to be here today, but I do have a          11:27:52

         5      statement that I'll read.  And we would like the        11:27:53

         6      opportunity to submit more information for the          11:27:54

         7      record.

         8                (Whereupon, Mr. Monroe presented

         9      Congressman Hall's comments as follows:

        10                CONGRESSMAN HALL:  I want to thank the

        11      members of this committee for the important work

        12      you are doing on behalf of the nation.  I also

        13      want to thank you for the opportunity to share

        14      my views on the human space flight-related

        15      policies of the NASA Authorization Acts of 2005

        16      and 2008.  The views expressed here are

        17      primarily mine, but I know they are shared by a

        18      number of my colleagues.

        19                I think it is important to note that

        20      the first authorization act of 2005, Public Law

        21      109-155, was the product of a Republican-led

        22      Congress and the second authorization act of


                                                              112



         1      2008, Public Law 110-422, was the product of a

         2      Democratically-led Congress.  Yet, in both cases

         3      the intent was the same, to enable NASA to

         4      succeed on its current path toward completion of

         5      the International Space Station, utilize the

         6      station to carry out world-class research,

         7      retire the space shuttle after completing its

         8      remaining flights without the constraint of a

         9      predetermined date and develop a new launch

        10      system capable of taking humans beyond low Earth

        11      orbit -- a feat the shuttle cannot do -- for the

        12      first time since the 1970s.


        13                In both of our authorizations we

        14      allocated more money than the Administration

        15      requested because, in our opinion, NASA was

        16      being asked to do too much with too little.  I

        17      am concerned that we cannot continue to be a

        18      preeminent space-faring nation without adequate

        19      Administration support and appropriate funding.

        20                One of the most important issues

        21      facing NASA -- and, indeed, our nation -- is the

        22      impending retirement of the space shuttle and


                                                              113



         1      the subsequent five-year gap in independent U.S.

         2      access to the $100 billion International Space

         3      Station.

         4                With the NASA Authorization Act of

         5      2005, Congress endorsed the development of the

         6      new spacecraft and launch vehicles -- and I

         7      stress "launch vehicles" plural -- with the goal

         8      of launching the new system, quote, as close to

         9      2010 as possible, unquote.

        10                In the NASA Authorization Act of 2008,

        11      Congress established the new system as a

        12      priority by stating, quote, developing the

        13      United States human space flight capabilities to

        14      allow independent American access to the

        15      International Space Station and to explore

        16      beyond low Earth orbit is a strategically

        17      important national imperative, emphasis added,

        18      and all prudent steps should, thus, be taken to

        19      bring the Orion crew exploration vehicle and

        20      Ares I crew launch vehicle to full operational

        21      capability as soon as possible and to ensure the

        22      effective development of a U.S. heavy-lift


                                                              114



         1      launch capabilities for missions beyond low

         2      Earth orbit, unquote.  As a result, the act

         3      sought to accelerate the development of the new

         4      system by authorizing an additional $1 billion

         5      in FY 2009.

         6                Looking longer term, we are very

         7      concerned that the current budget request has

         8      eliminated funding for the Ares V heavy-lift

         9      launcher, and the Altair lunar lander, without

        10      which America is unable to explore beyond low

        11      Earth orbit.

        12                The NASA Authorization Act of 2008


        13      also recognized the space shuttle's critical

        14      role in completing and utilizing the

        15      International Space Station and added one

        16      additional mission, if it could be done safely,

        17      to deliver the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.

        18                As authorizers, we are concerned that

        19      NASA may be unable to complete the remaining

        20      shuttle missions, including the AMS flight,

        21      before the end of 2010.  Unless the

        22      Administration and the Congress provide funds


                                                              115



         1      commensurate with extension, the Agency could be

         2      forced to take resources away from the

         3      development of the Orion and Ares, adding delays

         4      that could further jeopardize the 2015

         5      availability and contribute to further losses of

         6      our highly skilled aerospace workforce.

         7                I, along with many of my colleagues,

         8      am not in favor of excessive government

         9      spending.  But in this time of economic turmoil

        10      and growing international technological

        11      competitiveness, many of us are in agreement

        12      that America's space program is well-established

        13      on a path that, if sustained, will ensure our

        14      role as the world leader in space exploration

        15      and exploitation for decades to come.  By

        16      pursuing human space flight, we challenge our

        17      industry and inspire America to dream big and

        18      succeed.  That is what leadership is all about.

        19                Other countries recognize the

        20      strategic importance of the soft power we gained

        21      in the world through our audacious leadership in

        22      human space flight.  The political and


                                                              116



         1      technological stature of America has been earned

         2      through our space program has now sought -- is

         3      now sought by other nations eager to demonstrate

         4      their hard-won capabilities to the world.

         5                The International Space Station in

         6      orbit today is a remarkable achievement,

         7      bringing together the scientific and engineering

         8      talents and resources of many nations.  That

         9      achievement would not have been possible without

        10      American leadership.  But such leadership is

        11      built on trust that we will keep our commitments


        12      to our international partners.  If we continue

        13      to underfund our space program, we risk losing

        14      the international trust and credibility that is

        15      vital for long-term success.

        16                Today nearly 70 percent of the world's

        17      population was not alive to see Neil Armstrong

        18      walk on the Moon.  Their opinions will be shaped

        19      by what happens in the future, not what has

        20      happened in the past.

        21                We should not be in a race with China

        22      or any other country.  We are the preeminent


                                                              117



         1      leader in space.  But leadership is temporary.

         2      We should ensure that we take the necessary

         3      actions to remain the leader in human space

         4      flight.

         5                I want to thank the committee, once

         6      again, for this opportunity to share our

         7      minority views.                                         10:50:36

         9      Congressman Hall's comments concluded.)                 10:50:36

        10                MR. MUNROE:  Thank you.                       11:33:44

        11                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much           11:33:44

        12      for reading that, and please express our                11:33:45

        13      appreciation for the letter itself.                     11:33:49

        14                MR. MONROE:  Will do.  Thank you.             11:33:52

        15                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Good.  Is Senator             11:33:53

        16      Nelson here yet, do we know?                            11:33:58

        17                MR. McALISTER:  I don't think so.  He         11:34:02

        18      is on his way.                                          11:34:04

        19                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Let's see.  We were           11:34:06

        20      getting a letter from Senator Kay Bailey                11:34:07

        21      Hutchison.  Has that shown up?                          11:34:12

         4      ahead of schedule here.  I think what we can...         11:34:29

         7      public comment session early, and then we'll --         11:34:38

         8      when Senator Nelson gets here, we'll break and          11:34:42

         9      hear his remarks.                                       11:34:47

        10                MR. McALISTER:  Mr. Chairman, I've got        11:34:49

        11      some public comment information that we can go          11:34:49

        12      to and show on the screen before we pull                11:34:53

        13      everybody up.                                           11:35:00

        14                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Why don't you just            11:35:00

        15      handle the public comment session here yourself.        11:34:57

        16                MR. McALISTER:  Okay.                         11:34:49

        17                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Let's ask everyone to         11:35:00

        18      hold their comments to three minutes out of             11:35:03

        19      fairness to others who would like to comment.           11:35:07

        20      We have microphones, I think, in both aisles.           11:35:07

         1      acknowledge some of the comments that we                11:35:15

         2      received via the website.  We went live on the          11:35:16

         3      website on June 1st, and as of June 15th, we had        11:35:21

         4      almost 300 comments telling us what to do and           11:35:25

         5      how to do our work.  So it was very much                11:35:27

         6      appreciated, and that was a very -- it was an           11:35:29

         7      excellence response, and all of those comments          11:35:30

         8      and suggestions are getting read.                       11:35:32

         9                Again, the website location is                11:35:34

        11                Anyway, you can see the pie chart             11:35:44

        12      there.  That's the breakdown of the comments            11:35:46

        13      grouped by subject matter.                              11:35:50

        14                Constellation received about                  11:35:52


        15      10 percent of the comments.  The comments were          11:35:54

        16      mixed as to keeping the projects and some               11:35:56

        17      suggesting canceling them.  Most that were for          11:35:59

        18      keeping them asked that it be used to fill the          11:36:03

        19      gap between the shuttle and the next vehicle.           11:36:04

        20      And those that were recommending canceling these        11:36:06

        21      projects mostly discussed the cost and potential        11:36:09

        22      unreliability.                                          11:36:11

         1                Shuttle.  The shuttle comments were           11:36:13

         2      overwhelmingly in favor of continuing the               11:36:17

         3      shuttle.  The reasons fell into three groups            11:36:19

         4      primarily -- keeping ahead of the world in space        11:36:23

         5      travel, concern that we would lose the drive or         11:36:26

         6      ability to return to space and lack of                  11:36:29

         7      competence in follow-on programs.                       11:36:31

         8                Budget Concerns, another frequent             11:36:34

         9      topic.  Most of the comments showed an interest         11:36:36

        10      in increasing the budget for human space flight         11:36:36

        11      or a concern in the recent cut in the NASA              11:36:39

        12      budget that was announced on the House side             11:36:43

        13      recently.  We got a lot of -- we got a spike in         11:36:46

        14      comments right after that was done.                     11:36:48

        15                The Moon comments stressed the need to        11:36:49

        16      reach the Moon again.  Most of the comments on          11:36:53

        17      the Moon were in favor of that.  Also mentioning        11:36:54

        18      the need for a base of some sort to allow for           11:36:55

        19      either mining or solar power collection.                11:36:59

        20                Mars.  Most of the comments related to        11:37:01

        21      Mars stressed the need to skip the Moon, go             11:37:03

        22      straight to Mars or to have at least Mars as the        11:37:07

         1      ultimate goal for human exploration.                    11:37:10


         2                Other Destinations.  There was a              11:37:13

         3      grab-bag of other destinations.  Most of those          11:37:16

         4      were sort of beyond Mars type destinations.             11:37:18

         5                And then a number of science-related          11:37:22

         6      comments ranging from not wanting to explore            11:37:24

         7      space at all and focusing on Earth and Earth            11:37:27

         8      research to -- using space exploration to               11:37:36

         9      increase our technology here.  Also concern that        11:37:36

        10      space exploration would just be used as                 11:37:39

        11      political gain and not for actual science.  So          11:37:39

        12      there was a number of questions along those             11:37:43

        13      lines.                                                  11:37:44

        14                And I pulled out some examples.  These        11:37:45

        15      were just mine that I thought were                      11:37:47

        16      representative of some of the comments.                 11:37:49

        17                Sending a man to the Moon again and on        11:37:50

        18      to Mars has the value of growth of ideas and            11:37:50

        19      enhances the spirit of the people.  We have             11:37:53

        20      failed as a people if we let the space program          11:37:56

        21      go on without the human being stepping his foot         11:37:58

        22      on another planet.  With a U.S.-based commercial        11:38:00

         2      Constellation would be the last man launcher            11:38:06

         3      built by NASA.  I hope the committee will               11:38:09

         4      examine a new role for NASA as an enabling              11:38:13

         8      concentrate its resources on taking mankind back        11:38:22

         9      to the Moon and beyond.                                 11:38:23

        10                A comment from a NASA employee:  I'm          11:38:26

        11      an engineer working for NASA at KSC on                  11:38:27

        12      Constellation.  I wanted to express my desire to        11:38:31


        13      see specific recommendations and plans --               11:38:32

        14      specific recommendations and plans for this             11:38:34

        15      study.  I fear we may see the same old general          11:38:36

        16      open-ended inspirational message, which has left        11:38:41

        17      our agency adrift for far too long.  We need to         11:38:41

        18      have a firm idea about what our goals are and           11:38:45

        19      how to achieve them.  We need specifics.                11:38:47

        20                And then the last one.  I had to throw        11:38:49

        21      this one out.                                           11:38:51

        22                I just wanted to send a thank you note        11:38:51


                                                              123



         1      to all of those on the panel.  I trust you will         11:38:56

         2      make the right decisions with regards to a fair         11:38:58

         3      balance between human and robotic space flight          11:39:00

         4      without making human space flight -- taking             11:39:00

         5      human space flight from us completely.                  11:39:04

         6                So I definitely wanted to end on a            11:39:06

         7      thank you to us.                                        11:39:09

         8                And then just one other thought on the        11:39:10

         9      website.  We are encouraging a lot of                   11:39:14

        10      participation.  We want you to visit the                11:39:17

        11      website.  We're also twittering on the website,         11:39:19

        12      and as of June 15th, we had 721 followers,              11:39:22

        13      which, I'm told, is a very good number.  So keep        11:39:26

        14      following us.                                           11:39:30

        15                I think we have -- we are also                11:39:31

        16      twittering some messages realtime from the              11:39:33

        17      committee meeting.  So when you get back to your        11:39:37

        18      computer, check those.                                  11:39:41

        19                Okay.  Status on Senator Nelson?              11:39:42

        20                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Why don't we begin the        11:39:46

        21      public comments.                                        11:39:48

        22                Do you have a list of people who would        11:39:49



                                                              124



         1      like to speak, or should we just ask folks to           11:39:51

         2      come up?                                                11:39:53

         3                MR. McALISTER:  Right.  Again, per my         11:39:55

         4      comments this morning, please come up to one of         11:39:58

         5      the two standing mics.  We have one on both             11:39:59

         6      sides.  Please limit your comments to no more           11:40:01

         7      than three minutes, and the preference is for           11:40:04

         8      comments and not for questions.                         11:40:07

         9                Norman, go ahead and call them out as         11:40:07

        10      you see them.                                           11:40:12

        11                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Let's see.  Sir, we'll        11:40:12

        12      begin on this side.  Could you identify                 11:40:16

        13      yourself, please.                                       11:40:17

        14                MR. CITIZEN:  My is Greg Citizen.             11:40:18

        15      And, first of all, thank you for doing this             11:40:21

        16      important work.                                         11:40:23

        17                My concern with going back to the Moon        11:40:23

        18      is that we -- there is a lot of interest in the         11:40:26

        19      vehicles and in technology but there's still not        11:40:29

        20      a very clear idea, I think, in public about what        11:40:32

        21      we're really going to do when we get there.             11:40:35

        22                And especially given the idea of the          11:40:39


                                                              125



         1      Moon as a stepping stone to future places, I            11:40:40

         2      don't have a good sense that we have a real plan        11:40:43

         3      in place, at least not publicly discussed, that         11:40:46

         4      really addresses things like what are we going          11:40:48

         5      to do, how are we going to develop things that          11:40:51

         6      are going to make the Moon a good stepping              11:40:53

         7      stone, what kinds of -- for example,                    11:40:55

         8      manufacturing on the Moon seems to be an                11:40:57

         9      important part of using that as a stepping              11:41:00

        10      stone, being able to produce things on the Moon.        11=
:41:03

        11      That doesn't seem to be coming up a lot.                11:41:06

        12                So I would ask the committee to,              11:41:09

        13      please, bear in mind also not just the                  11:41:10

        14      technologies that get us to the Moon but also           11:41:12

        15      what are we going to do once we get there.              11:41:15

        16      Because that's going to be a very important             11:41:18

        17      role, I think, of anything in terms of trying to        11:41:21

        18      sell this program and then trying to keep               11:41:22

        19      forward momentum going.                                 11:41:24

        20                Apollo petered our very quickly, in           11:41:27

        21      part, because people got very used -- once we           11:41:28

        22      got past the anticipation of getting to the             11:41:30


                                                              126



         1      Moon, we got very used to seeing astronauts             11:41:33

         2      against a gray background doing the                     11:41:36

         3      moment-to-moment work, and I think we need a            11:41:39

         4      very good vision of what we're going to do on           11:41:42

         5      the Moon if we're going to sustain that.                11:41:44

         6                Thank you.                                    11:41:47

         7                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          11:41:47

         8                Sir...                                        11:41:47

         9                MR. FITCH:  Good morning.  My name is         11:41:56

        10      Osa Fitch, and I'm a private citizen of the             11:41:57

        11      United States.                                          11:42:00

        12                I would like to thank the committee           11:42:01

        13      for this opportunity to provide input into your         11:42:03

        14      view of the plans for U.S. Human Space Flight.          11:42:05

        15      As an American taxpayer with a technical                11:42:07

        16      background in aerospace, I care about the United        11:42:07

        17      States' Human Space Flight programs on many,            11:42:13

        18      many fronts.                                            11:42:13

        19                I'd like to make two major points to          11:42:16

        20      the committee.                                          11:42:18


        21                First is that the vision for space            11:42:19

        22      exploration, I believe, is fundamentally sound,         11:42:22


                                                              127



         1      and as an underlying mission and rationale for          11:42:25

         2      NASA's involvement in human space flight, I'd           11:42:30

         3      like to see that continue.                              11:42:32

         4                Second, NASA's Constellation, program         11:42:33

         5      as currently structured, is really on the path          11:42:35

         6      to failure, I believe, and it will not achieve          11:42:35

         7      the vision for space exploration and it's likely        11:42:39

         8      to continue to fail until it is fundamentally           11:42:42

         9      restructured.                                           11:42:44

        10                Regarding the VSE, any United States          11:42:45

        11      government Human Space Flight program needs to          11:42:48

        12      be shaped such that it inspires all Americans           11:42:49

        13      and it does not compete with commercial                 11:42:52

        14      enterprises.  The VSE, with its focus on moving         11:42:57

        15      beyond low Earth orbit operations, meets this           11:42:58

        16      need in both of these areas.  I support this            11:43:00

        17      vision, and I believe that all Americans support        11:43:03

        18      this vision if it can be executed in a cost             11:43:05

        19      effective manner.                                       11:43:09

        20                Human space flight also inspires              11:43:10

        21      people all over the world.                              11:43:13

        22                Regarding NASA's Constellation                11:43:15


                                                              128



         1      program, that are two basic problems that I             11:43:17

         2      believe need to be addressed.                           11:43:20

         3                One, the system requirements have been        11:43:21

         4      set in a manner that does not account for any of        11:43:22

         5      the real-world constraints based by a                   11:43:24

         6      government-run Human Space Flight program.              11:43:27

         7                The largest issue facing the country          11:43:28


         8      at this point in history is the current economic        11:43:31

         9      crisis.  Any government-run Human Space Flight          11:43:32

        10      program must operate in an environment of fixed         11:43:35

        11      or declining real budgets.  Picking arbitrary           11:43:36

        12      mission requirements and then assuming that the         11:43:41

        13      budget will be made available to develop                11:43:42

        14      arbitrary systems to meet those requirements            11:43:45

        15      is -- in a monolithic architecture is                   11:43:47

        16      unrealistic in the economic and financial               11:43:51

        17      environment we face today.                              11:43:53

        18                Two, the Ares launcher development            11:43:55

        19      program has basically run off the rails.  It is         11:43:56

        20      developing two all new and unaffordable launch          11:43:58

        21      systems.  The Ares I program, even if                   11:44:02

        22      successful, fundamentally duplicates existing           11:44:02


                                                              129



         1      launcher capability without adding anything new         11:44:07

         2      of value, but it does so at great cost to the           11:44:10

         3      taxpayer and that cost is growing daily.                11:44:11

         4                The technical limitations of the              11:44:14

         5      Ares I launcher have had significant negative           11:44:16

         6      impact on the other areas of the Constellation          11:44:20

         7      program, particularly on the Orion spacecraft,          11:44:20

         8      forcing multiple redesigns and the elimination          11:44:25

         9      of many important spacecraft systems, including         11:44:27

        10      safety features and reusability features.               11:44:29

        11                The Ares V has grown into a rocket            11:44:32

        12      with little commonality with Ares I and almost          11:44:35

        13      no commonality at all with the existing space           11:44:36

        14      shuttle system, including infrastructure.               11:44:38

        15                Because Ares I and Ares V are two             11:44:41

        16      different launchers, the flight rate for each           11:44:41

        17      will be lower than if a single launcher were            11:44:43

        18      used for both missions, driving up costs.               11:44:46


        19      Because of the enormous size of the Ares V              11:44:49

        20      launcher, its flight rate will be very low,             11:44:49

        21      driving up costs for it yet even further.               11:44:53

        22                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Could I ask you to            11:44:56


                                                              130



         1      wrap up, please.                                        11:44:57

         2                MR. FISH:  I'm wrapping up right now,         11:44:57

         3      sir.                                                    11:44:57

         4                Okay.  I'd like to make two points as         11:44:59

         5      possible solutions.                                     11:45:02

         6                One, switch to a capabilities-based           11:45:03

         7      approach and leverage systems that already              11:45:05

         8      exist, do it with minimum development to get to         11:45:07

         9      an architecture that can be scaled and grown            11:45:11

        10      over time.                                              11:45:12

        11                You're going to hear several                  11:45:14

        12      presentations today, I believe, including EELV,         11:45:14

        13      Direct, space shuttle side-mounted options.  Any        11:45:15

        14      of these may take that approach.  I urge you to         11:45:19

        15      give strong considerations to those.                    11:45:22

        16                Second, focus on cost as an                   11:45:24

        17      independent variable.  We've got to understand          11:45:27

        18      that we've got a fixed budget, take what we             11:45:28

        19      have, put it together in a different way to             11:45:31

        20      achieve a vision that can be grown over time.           11:45:33

        21                I will go ahead and wrap it up here,          11:45:37

        22      sir.  Thank you very much.                              11:45:39


                                                              131



         1                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          11:45:40

         2                Sir...                                        11:45:41

         3                MR. FINGERHUT:  Hi, my name is Henry          11:45:41

         4      Fingerhut.  I'm a student at Georgetown                 11:45:43

         5      University and an intern with the NASA Academy          11:45:43


         6      program.                                                11:45:46

         7                I guess I had more of, I guess, an            11:45:47

         8      open-ended -- or, I guess, more nebulous per se         11:45:49

         9      question, but given -- or a comment.  But given         11:45:52

        10      the trend of, I guess, tenuously bound projects         11:45:55

        11      that NASA has taken up since the Apollo program         11:46:00

        12      and the remarks of Director Dordain of ESA about        11:46:00

        13      the importance of continuity when rationale for         11:46:06

        14      a current project is still valid, I just think          11:46:09

        15      it's important to, I guess, more critically             11:46:13

        16      question whether Constellation fosters -- or to         11:46:14

        17      what extent Constellation fosters a compelling          11:46:18

        18      public image of our continuity or overall               11:46:22

        19      direction for the agency.                               11:46:23

        20                I know Representative Olson mentioned         11:46:25

        21      that the problem is not a lack of vision but a          11:46:27

        22      lack of commitment.  But it's important, I              11:46:30


                                                              132



         1      think, to look into how that commitment is made         11:46:32

         2      such that the vision isn't compromised.                 11:46:36

         3                And finally I just wanted to mention          11:46:41

         4      that I think we should look at -- we should be          11:46:43

         5      looking into the extent to which we can look            11:46:43

         6      beyond Constellation to ensure that it doesn't          11:46:47

         7      become just another in a series of, I guess,            11:46:49

         8      more incremental discontinuous missions,                11:46:51

         9      especially, for example, through the end of our         11:46:54

        10      careers as the next generation of engineers and         11:46:56

        11      scientists.                                             11:46:56

        12                So I guess that's really more broad           11:47:03

        13      based than a lot of the other questions, but I          11:47:03

        14      think it's still important to keep in the back          11:47:05

        15      of one's mind as they make these decisions.             11:47:07

        16                MR. AUGUSTINE:  We appreciate your            11:47:09


        17      comments.                                               11:47:11

        18                MR. FINGERHUT:  Thank you.                    11:47:11

        19                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sir...                        11:47:12

        20                MR. LANFORD:  Hi, my name is Ephraim          11:47:12

        21      Lanford.  I just wanted to voice a slight               11:47:13

        22      concern about the committee's, I guess,                 11:47:15


                                                              133



         1      authority and perhaps charter to explore the            11:47:19

         2      implications and possibilities of international         11:47:25

         3      leadership.  So if there are -- if the committee        11:47:27

         4      thinks that there are ways to use the space             11:47:33

         5      program to draw attention to or reveal or               11:47:37

         6      distribute benefits of international cooperation        11:47:40

         7      in broad areas like global markets, weapons             11:47:44

         8      non-proliferation, perhaps human rights in maybe        11:47:50

         9      a particular country that some are considering          11:47:53

        10      inviting to the ISS or to global aspects of more        11:47:56

        11      specific questions that are kind of more                11:48:01

        12      traditional, such as education and inspiration          11:48:03

        13      or industrial base, then I hope that the                11:48:06

        14      committee will -- I mean, you know, this is my          11:48:10

        15      opinion -- but not be abash to seek the, I              11:48:14

        16      guess, input or guidelines that it needs at a           11:48:21

        17      high level to consider questions of high level          11:48:24

        18      policy and diplomacy to explore all of these            11:48:30

        19      issues to the fullest.  Thank you.                      11:48:35

        20                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you.                    11:48:37

        21                UNKNOWN SPEAKER:  Good morning.  I            11:48:39

        22      also want to thank you, gentlemen and ladies,           11:48:41


                                                              134



         1      for the -- serving on the panel.                        11:48:43

         2                I started my act in my career in the          11:48:45

         3      early '60s for the infamous Sputnik and have            11:48:48


         4      been involved in the industry now for 45 years,         11:48:54

         5      thereabouts, and I think one thing that I've            11:48:59

         6      heard several times here regarding the extension        11:49:01

         7      of the Constellation to Mars -- it's certainly          11:49:05

         8      my opinion -- and I believe it's the Earth to           11:49:08

         9      Mars that is really going to have the                   11:49:12

        10      technological breakthrough.  Of course, most of         11:49:17

        11      us have been to Mars -- or not personally but --        11:49:19

        12      the Mars episode -- I'm sorry -- to the Moon,           11:49:23

        13      and I think it's the Mars that's going to get us        11:49:24

        14      the real, real big next step in technology.             11:49:27

        15                Thank you.                                    11:49:31

        16                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          11:49:31

        17                DR. CRAWLEY:  Mr. Chairman, I wonder          11:49:36

        18      if I might make a request.                              11:49:37

        19                The committee is sincerely interested         11:49:39

        20      in very broad base of input from the national           11:49:42

        21      community and particularly from the youth.  As          11:49:46

        22      we've already heard several references today,           11:49:48


                                                              135



         1      one of the principal political incentives in            11:49:51

         2      creating a broad-based human exploration program        11:49:56

         3      is inspiration of youth.  It's continually              11:50:00

         4      referenced, in fact, even interestingly in the          11:50:03

         5      comments today by our Russia colleague.                 11:50:04

         6                So I would especially invite the youth        11:50:08

         7      of America to comment via all of the appropriate        11:50:11

         8      mechanisms that only they know how to do, like          11:50:14

         9      twittering back and blogging.  There are several        11:50:15

        10      blogs going on.  And we'd really like to hear           11:50:19

        11      from the youth of America what would inspire            11:50:22

        12      them and how they would like to get engaged.            11:50:26

        13                MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think that's a great        11:50:29

        14      requests, and we hope that those who are                11=
:50:32

        15      watching on television will heed that request.          11:50:34

        16                While we have a moment here --                11:50:39

        17                MR. McALISTER:  Norm, a quick update.         11:50:41

        18      Representative Nelson is here.  I'm sorry.              11:50:46

        19      Senator Nelson.                                         11:50:49

        20                (Discussion off the record.)                  11:51:31

        21                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Here means here in            11:51:31

        22      Washington or here on Earth?                            11:51:34


                                                              136



         1                (Discussion off the record.)                  11:51:34

         2                MR. AUGUSTINE:  You know, we're going         11:52:41

         3      through comments from the folks from                    11:52:42

         4      Capitol Hill that have an interest in this              11:52:44

         5      program -- a particular interest in it.                 11:52:47

         6                Senator Nelson, of course, has a long         11:52:49

         7      and personal involvement in the program and has         11:52:52

         8      been truly one of the great supporters of NASA          11:52:57

         9      and the space program.                                  11:53:01

        10                We're awful glad you're here, and we          11:53:03

        11      welcome your thoughts.                                  11:53:06

        12                SENATOR NELSON:  Thank you,                   11:53:07

        13      Mr. Chairman.  And I'm going to move over here          11:53:08

        14      where I can actually see you all instead of             11:53:10

        15      looking at the side of your head.                       11:53:13

        16                I want you to understand the                  11:53:16

        17      extraordinarily significant position that this          11:53:20

        18      panel brings itself to the table.  Because, in          11:53:23

        19      essence, what you decide is going to be the             11:53:30

        20      significant influence for the White House and,          11:53:38

        21      therefore, also for the Congress in where the           11:53:45

        22      space program is going.                                 11:53:51


                                                              137



         1                And so I know you all know that, but I        11:53:52

         2      want you to hear from somebody that lives it            11:53:55

         3      every day that, if you decide that X is going to        11:53:59

         4      be the case, the White House is a lot more              11:54:06

         5      likely to embrace X, and whether or not I or            11:54:18

         6      others disagree with X, it makes it much more           11:54:21

         7      difficult for us to be able to round up the             11:54:24

         8      votes in this kind of financial environment             11:54:27

         9      other than what you say is X.                           11:54:33

        10                So you come to the table with                 11:54:38

        11      extraordinary influence.  And I know you all            11:54:41

        12      take the seriousness of this very much, but I           11:54:47

        13      wanted you to understand when we're dealing with        11:54:51

        14      a budget that is out of whack as bad as it is --        11:54:53

        15      and I've just come from the finance committee           11:54:58

        16      trying to figure out what we're going to pass in        11:55:01

        17      the way of health reform, and, of course, costs         11:55:04

        18      are a major consideration.                              11:55:08


        19                And so a lot of what -- I wish it             11:55:12

        20      weren't this way, but a lot of where we're going        11:55:18

        21      with regard to our space program -- which 10,           11:55:21

        22      15, 20, 25 years down the line we may not have          11:55:24


                                                              138



         1      wished we had made in the prism of financial            11:55:30

         2      restraints, but that's the reality that we're           11:55:35

         3      dealing with now.                                       11:55:39

         4                So for your consideration, I think            11:55:42

         5      that you ought to seriously understand that from        11:55:47

         6      this Senator's perspective and what the Office          11:55:50

         7      of Management and Budget have laid out for the          11:55:56

         8      President's plan in the out-years of '011, '12,         11:55:58

         9      '13 and '14 are entirely deficient for where            11:56:06

        10      we're going.                                            11:56:13

        11                Now, part of your charter is that you         11:56:14

        12      are to lay out options, and you're also to be           11:56:16

        13      mindful of the fiscal restraints.  NASA simply          11:56:21

        14      can't do the job that it's been given with the          11:56:28

        15      President's goal of being on the Moon by 2020 if        11:56:33

        16      you take the OMB numbers.                               11:56:37

        17                I have clashed swords with Dr. Orzag,         11:56:42

        18      who I have a great deal of respect.  I have sat         11:56:47

        19      in prayer sessions with Dr. Holgren.  And I just        11:56:52

        20      want you to know that if you come out with those        11:57:01

        21      numbers, there's no way that NASA can be on the         11:57:05

        22      Moon by 2020.                                           11:57:09


                                                              139



         1                There's no way that with those numbers        11:57:13

         2      that are coming -- and there's nothing magic            11:57:16

         3      about those numbers.  Those numbers were from a         11:57:20

         4      group of folks who -- trying to come out with a         11:57:23

         5      President's political document -- in addition to        11:57:28

         6      it being an economic document -- about showing          11:57:31

         7      how over the next five years that you get the           11:57:34

         8      budget deficient down to 3 percent of the Gross         11:57:39

         9      National Product.                                       11:57:43

        10                But the President starts out crippled         11:57:44

        11      because he's inheriting what he thought was a           11:57:48

        12      $1.7 trillion deficient in the current year but,        11:57:52

        13      in fact, it's going to be closer to                     11:57:56

        14      1.9 trillion.  So understand the context in             11:58:02

        15      which that is.                                          11:58:05

        16                If you adopted those out-year numbers         11:58:07

        17      of the President's budget -- which I'm trying to        11:58:09

        18      tell you is really not the President's budget.          11:58:12

        19      Therefore, that's all of the more reason your           11:58:17

        20      panel is important.  Because the President is           11:58:20

        21      looking to you to really come up with where we          11:58:23

        22      should go in our space program.                         11:58:28



                                                              140



         1                But if you adopted those numbers, we          11:58:31

         2      would have a four- or five-year gap with no             11:58:35

         3      American human-rated launch system, and that            11:58:40

         4      would expand to six, seven, possibly eight              11:58:46

         5      years.  And I don't think anybody wants us to           11:58:50

         6      continue in the circumstance where we are -- the        11:58:53

         7      only way to get to the International Space              11:58:57

         8      Station, which we built and paid for to the tune        11:59:00

         9      of $100 billion -- that we want to continue to          11:59:03

        10      stay in a multiyear period dependent upon the           11:59:07

        11      Russians.                                               11:59:16

        12                It's my hope that our foreign                 11:59:17

        13      relations with the Russians are going to get            11:59:19

        14      better, but who knows what the geopolitics is           11:59:21

        15      going to be later on in this coming decade.  So         11:59:28

        16      I ask you to consider that.                             11:59:31

        17                I also ask you to consider that the           11:59:32

        18      last several years of budgets haven't been              11:59:35

        19      realistic.  NASA was asked to do too much with          11:59:39

        20      too little, and that has led us to the point            11:59:42

        21      that we are now -- with a space shuttle that's          11:59:48

        22      going to shut down but without the new rocket           11:59:52


                                                              141



         1      having been developed in time to pick up where          11:59:55

         2      the space shuttle leaves off and a series of            11:59:58

         3      budget documents over the last several years            12:00:04

         4      that, in fact, were unrealistic because they            12:00:07

         5      only went out to 2015 and played like the               12:00:10

         6      International Space Station was going to go away        12:00:14

         7      in 2015.                                                12:00:17

         8                Well, if it's taken this long to build        12:00:18

         9      it and it is really a wonderful tool in foreign         12:00:21


        10      relations in the fact that it truly is                  12:00:29

        11      international and if we've spent $100 billion, I        12:00:31

        12      don't think we want to shut it down in 2015.            12:00:36

        13      And, therefore, I think you ought to consider in        12:00:39

        14      your deliberations the continuation of that.            12:00:43

        15                Now, you all had specifically asked me        12:00:46

        16      to make a comment -- and then I will sit down           12:00:49

        17      within my prescribed time -- about where we are         12:00:52

        18      with regard to the NASA authorization bill.             12:01:02

        19                We authorized NASA's funding for the          12:01:04

        20      next several years in a 2008 NASA authorization         12:01:07

        21      bill, and the policy of that authorization bill         12:01:14

        22      is exactly what I've just said.  The funding was        12:01:19


                                                              142



         1      not what I've just said, but the authorization          12:01:25

         2      for funding is what I have just said, that the          12:01:29

         3      policy was to reduce the gap in human space             12:01:34

         4      flight capability and also, because of that, to         12:01:39

         5      mitigate the impact of having to lay off a              12:01:45

         6      dedicated workforce of highly skilled workers.          12:01:49

         7                And so you will see that the                  12:01:54

         8      authorization for the current year, 2009, when          12:01:57

         9      you add the $400 million that we got in in the          12:02:01

        10      stimulus for exploration, it actually brought it        12:02:06

        11      up to the funding -- the appropriations, it             12:02:11

        12      actually brought it up close to what the                12:02:14

        13      authorization was, which was $3.9 billion for           12:02:18

        14      exploration in the current year, whereas what we        12:02:22

        15      authorized for space operations, which was well         12:02:30

        16      above the President's request -- I'll round             12:02:34

        17      it -- 6 billion -- what was appropriated was            12:02:38

        18      about $250 million less than that, and yet you          12:02:44

        19      still have to -- have to launch the space               12:02:48

        20      shuttle.  So appropriations just simply didn't          12:02:51


        21      match what was authorized.                              12:02:58

        22                We got some help through the omnibus          12:03:01


                                                              143



         1      appropriations and the stimulus bill of getting         12:03:07

         2      additional money in, but other than that, the           12:03:12

         3      projections for the future in the President's           12:03:16

         4      budget are unrealistic.                                 12:03:20

         5                Just a couple of other comments on the        12:03:23

         6      authorization bill.  We said science and                12:03:27

         7      exploration should not be in competition with           12:03:33

         8      each other, they're compatible.                         12:03:36

         9                We clearly nailed down the policy that        12:03:40

        10      we ought to be prepared to operate the Space            12:03:42

        11      Station until 2020 and that we had to put it in         12:03:48

        12      because back then NASA was operating like they          12:03:57

        13      had two additional missions.  They had some             12:04:00

        14      term -- oh, they called them contingent.                12:04:08

        15                And as we would bring the                     12:04:12

        16      administrator in front of us -- well, why do you        12:04:17

        17      call it a contingent.  Well, I can tell you             12:04:20

        18      Dr. Griffin didn't want to call it contingent.          12:04:23

        19      He was being -- calling it contingent simply            12:04:25

        20      because the Office of Management and Budget was         12:04:28

        21      telling him that he had to.  And so we said,            12:04:31

        22      well, why is it contingent.  And basically it           12:04:34


                                                              144



         1      came out in the hearings that that was just a           12:04:37

         2      name.                                                   12:04:39

         3                So you're looking at a full complement        12:04:40

         4      of space shuttle missions to fully assemble and         12:04:45

         5      to equip the International Space Station.               12:04:51

         6                And then we did one more thing in the         12:04:55

         7      authorization bill.  We authorized an additional        12:04:58

         8      flight.  And that was there were a bunch of             12:05:02

         9      scientific instruments that were going to be            12:05:05

        10      left on the ground that were configured to fly          12:05:08

        11      in the cargo bay of the space shuttle but NASA          12:05:11

        12      wasn't planning for it.  It wasn't NASA.  It was        12:05:15

        13      OMB wasn't planning for it.                             12:05:20

        14                And to the credit of the new                  12:05:22

        15      President, this is one of the commitments that          12:05:25

        16      he made in the course of the campaign, and he           12:05:27

        17      has fulfilled that commitment by adding the             12:05:31

        18      additional flight.  So that from now on, there          12:05:35

        19      are eight flights remaining of the space                12:05:40

        20      shuttle.                                                12:05:42

        21                The one other thing that the                  12:05:42

        22      President has committed to is that -- although          12:05:44


                                                              145



         1      budgetary-wise NASA, because OMB tells them to          12:05:48


         2      do this, is planning that the space shuttle is          12:05:54

         3      going to shut down by the end of 2010, the              12:05:57

         4      President has committed publicly that if we do          12:06:00

         5      not get the rest of the eight flights up by the         12:06:05

         6      end of 2010 that we will continue to fly the            12:06:08

         7      space shuttle until those eight flights -- which        12:06:13

         8      includes the last one, the scientific missions          12:06:17

         9      including the AMS -- until they are all flown to        12:06:20

        10      complete the construction of the station and the        12:06:24

        11      equipping of it.                                        12:06:29

        12                So that could have some financial             12:06:32

        13      consequences.  If we go into 2011, then                 12:06:34

        14      additional moneys are going to have to be               12:06:38

        15      generated -- and I made sure they got on the            12:06:44

        16      record publicly on this -- and not take that out        12:06:47

        17      of the rest of NASA's budget.                           12:06:51

        18                So that's a summary, Mr. Chairman, of         12:06:56

        19      what I wanted to tell you.                              12:07:03

        20                Now, I would just add one other               12:07:08

        21      thing -- that NASA is now going to have a great         12:07:10

        22      leader and this is someone that I worked very           12:07:15


                                                              146



         1      hard to get drawn to the attention of the               12:07:20

         2      White House and President, and it has been a            12:07:29

         3      very happy day for me and, I think, many others         12:07:31

         4      in NASA in the space community that the                 12:07:35

         5      President has nominated -- and I expect soon to         12:07:38

         6      be confirmed by the Senate -- Charlie Bolden.           12:07:43

         7                I think he brings the quality of being        12:07:48

         8      able to be not only a strong leader with an             12:07:50

         9      enormous understanding of both human and                12:07:56

        10      unmanned space but I think he brings the                12:07:58

        11      qualities of a consensus builder, which is so           12:08:03


        12      necessary at a time like this.                          12:08:07

        13                So with that kind of leadership, with         12:08:11

        14      the imprimatur of what you decide, which I think        12:08:15

        15      is going to be key, as to where our space               12:08:22

        16      program is going in the future -- with the two          12:08:25

        17      of those, we ought to be off on a good road             12:08:30

        18      ahead for the nation's space program.                   12:08:34

        19                I am happy to entertain any questions         12:08:37

        20      or comments from you all.                               12:08:39

        21                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, Senator, thank          12:08:42

        22      you very much.  You certainly encapsulate, I            12:08:44


                                                              147



         1      think, the challenges that the space program            12:08:47

         2      faces.  Your comments are very sobering to us.          12:08:50

         3      I think we well realize the responsibility we           12:08:55

         4      have, and you certainly sharpened that in our           12:08:58

         5      views.                                                  12:09:02

         6                Do any of my colleagues have questions        12:09:02

         7      that you would like to ask?                             12:09:04

         8                I've had a chance to visit with the           12:09:05

         9      Senator some in his office on this subject in           12:09:08

        10      the last couple of weeks, so I won't ask                12:09:12

        11      anything.  But if anybody else does, this is the        12:09:14

        12      time.                                                   12:09:17

        13                And I think that nobody has anything          12:09:19

        14      for you.  So we'll just thank you so much --            12:09:21

        15                SENATOR NELSON:  Thank you,                   12:09:26

        16      Mr. Chairman.                                           12:09:26

        17                MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- for being here.            12:09:22

        18                SENATOR NELSON:  Thank you.                   12:09:26

        19                MR. AUGUSTINE:  All the best.                 12:09:24

        20                SENATOR NELSON:  Thank you.                   12:09:26

        21                MR. AUGUSTINE:  One other thing before        12:09:27

        22      we take a break for lunch.  Senator Hutchison           12:09:29



                                                              148



         1      asked that I read a letter.  She had hoped to be        12:09:32

         2      here today, and as you heard, the transactions          12:09:36

         3      on the Hill have interfered with the best laid          12:09:40

         4      plans.  And so I will read her letter into the          12:09:44

         5      record here.                                            12:09:49

         6                This is, as I said, from Senator Kay          12:09:50

         7      Bailey Hutchison.                                       12:09:54

         8                (Whereupon, Mr. Augustine presented

         9      Senator Hutchison's letter as follows:

        10                SENATOR HUTCHISON:  Mr. Chairman and

        11      Members of the Human Space Flight Review Panel,

        12      I want to thank you for the opportunity to

        13      provide a statement in this hearing to

        14      underscore some of the recent congressional

        15      authorization activity that is relevant to your

        16      review of U.S. Human Space Flight programs.

        17                You have a huge challenge and a

        18      critical responsibility, and I appreciate your

        19      willingness to devote the time necessary to

        20      conduct this review.

        21                The first point that should be clear

        22      from both the 2005 and 2008 NASA Authorization


                                                              149



         1      Acts is that they reflect a broad, bi-partisan,

         2      bicameral level of support for the U.S. Human

         3      Space Flight programs.  More specifically, both

         4      bills express support for the goal of returning

         5      to the Moon to conduct the kind of sustained

         6      human exploration that was not possible in the

         7      Apollo program.

         8                They express support for completing

         9      the International Space Station and making the

        10      maximum possible use of its laboratory

        11      facilities for microgravity research across a

        12      broad range of science disciplines.  The 2005

        13      Act designated the Space Station as a national

        14      laboratory and began its evolution to a facility

        15      that not only can meet NASA's research needs but

        16      those of other government agencies, educational

        17      consortia and private research and development

        18      concerns.

        19                Both bills conveyed the concern of the


        20      Congress regarding the pending gap in the

        21      U.S. human space flight capability, a gap that

        22      would begin voluntarily with the end of space


                                                              150



         1      shuttle operations, mandated not by technical,

         2      engineering, structural or systemic issues but

         3      by a zero-sum budget plan that would require

         4      transferring the funds being spent on the

         5      shuttle to the efforts to develop its

         6      replacement vehicles, the Ares launch vehicles

         7      and the Orion crew exploration vehicle.

         8                Both bills also demonstrated a serious

         9      degree of concern for the difficult transition

        10      from one launch system to the next and the

        11      potential impacts to the highly and, in many

        12      cases, uniquely qualified and dedicated people

        13      across the country who support our nation's

        14      human space flight programs, whether they be

        15      civil servants, contractors, vendors or

        16      suppliers.

        17                The potential loss of many of these

        18      skilled resources represents a severe

        19      disturbance within the "Gathering Storm" that

        20      the Chairman has clearly outlined in his most

        21      recent contribution to U.S. policy in these

        22      areas of science, technology, engineering and


                                                              151



         1      mathematics excellence and competitiveness.  It

         2      has long-term implications, not only in places

         3      like Houston and the Johnson Space Center in my

         4      part of the country but across a broad spectrum

         5      of the country's industrial capabilities and to

         6      the vitality of its most skilled workforce.

         7                We must also not forget that America's

         8      leadership in space plays an important role in

         9      our nation's national security.  We have already

        10      seen the preeminent role that space-based

        11      technology plays in modern warfare and

        12      intelligence gathering.  Maintaining our efforts

        13      in human space flight is an essential part of

        14      sustaining the nation's overall space

        15      leadership.

        16                There is not adequate time today to

        17      give you more than this brief overview of the

        18      primary intentions behind the actions and

        19      legislation of our subcommittee and the Congress


        20      that I believe you need to be aware of and

        21      factor into your deliberations.

        22                My committee staff has prepared a


                                                              152



         1      collection of the relevant language, supporting

         2      and related information from NASA, the General

         3      Accountability Office and the Congressional

         4      Budget Office and a broader description of the

         5      issues and concerns we have addressed and

         6      continue to address as we draft a 2009

         7      authorization bill, which we will provide to

         8      you.  My staff will be available to provide any

         9      further detailed information you feel is needed.

        10                Finally I want to stress my belief

        11      that you must be able to consider any and all

        12      possible options and alternatives to ensure the

        13      continuation and future success of the U.S.

        14      human space flight programs.  I believe it is

        15      essential for your review to be unconstrained by

        16      any binding consideration, whether budgetary or

        17      programmatic.

        18                We in the Congress and, I believe, the

        19      Administration, must be given a clear picture of

        20      what is attainable and what resources would be

        21      required.  We will then be in a position to make

        22      the judgments necessary to achieve the best


                                                              153



         1      possible and most affordable result for the

         2      American taxpayer.

         3                Again, I want to thank you for your

         4      commitment to this enormous task, and I look

         5      forward to seeing the result of your efforts.  I

         6      commend you for joining with this Administration

         7      and my colleagues at the Congress to derive the

         8      best possible path forward to sustain an

         9      essential national effort and preserve our

        10      country's leadership in space.                          10:50:36

        11                (Whereupon, the presentation of               10:50:36

        12      Senator Hutchison's letter concluded.)                  10:50:36

        13                MR. AUGUSTINE:  We now are actually,          12:14:20

        14      through the very good chairmanship, 15 minutes          12:14:22

        15      ahead, and we could take a break for lunch.             12:14:28

        16                And what I would suggest we do is             12:14:31


        17      start the afternoon session 15 minutes early,           12:14:34

        18      because I'm a great believer of having                  12:14:39

        19      contingencies in budgets and schedules.                 12:14:39

        20                I've received a number of notes handed        12:14:43

        21      to me from my colleagues as I had to walk out of        12:14:45

        22      the room for a moment citing that you're                12:14:49


                                                              154



         1      freezing to death, and so I wonder if there's --        12:14:52

         2      we're not trying to simulate the Mars atmosphere        12:14:54

         3      here, but if it's possible, could we get a              12:14:58

         4      little more heat in here before we come back.           12:15:00

         5      And we will plan to meet at 12:45 to continue.          12:15:01

         6                Thank you all.                                12:15:07

         7                (Lunch recess.)                               12:15:07

         8                MR. HAWES:  Good afternoon.  I'm Mike         13:05:12

         9      Hawes from NASA, and I would like to take just a        13:05:15

        10      few minutes to kick off our afternoon session           13:05:18

        11      and explain some of the content that we have            13:05:21

        12      this afternoon.                                         13:05:23

        13                As I described early this morning,            13:05:24

        14      there are a number of studies, a number of              13:05:26

        15      concepts and alternatives that have been                13:05:29

        16      proposed by a variety of folks, and we have             13:05:33

        17      tried to get many of those fundamentally on the         13:05:36

        18      table today through all of these presentations.         13:05:40

        19                So I would like to just kind of walk          13:05:45

        20      through kind of a quick look at this afternoon's        13:05:47

        21      set of presentations, Norm.  And since you know         13:05:49

        22      I need to duck out early, I appreciate the              13:05:50


                                                              155



         1      forbearance so I can do this and duck out.              13:05:50

         2                The first set of topics that will             13:05:55

         3      start right as soon as I'm done is -- we called         13:05:58


         4      EELV considerations, and in that we would ask           13:06:03

         5      NASA Lynn Cline to talk about our current use of        13:06:06

         6      the EELVs.                                              13:06:10

         7                We would then ask ULA -- and I believe        13:06:12

         8      it's going to be Mike Gass -- to present ULA's          13:06:14

         9      activities as well.                                     13:06:20

        10                And then everybody knows, imagine             13:06:21

        11      that, that there has been an Aerospace study            13:06:26

        12      going on about use of EELVs.  Is that a surprise        13:06:30

        13      to anybody in the room?  Okay.                          13:06:34

        14                We have managed to get to where we can        13:06:35

        15      have a public briefing of some of the summary           13:06:39

        16      comments from that report.  Gary Pulliam from           13:06:42

        17      Aerospace will talk about that.  We don't have a        13:06:47

        18      final report yet.  We've had to do a public             13:06:50

        19      version of that report, and we're still in the          13:06:54

        20      final throes of clearance.  But Gary is here,           13:06:58

        21      and he's going to give us the top level findings        13:06:58

        22      of that.                                                13:07:00


                                                              156



         1                After that, then we're also going to          13:07:02

         2      talk about some of our other launch providers           13:07:02

         3      and particularly talk about our Commercial              13:07:05

         4      Orbital -- COTS program.                                13:07:14

         5                And, again, in a similar fashion, ask         13:07:16

         6      NASA -- in the first case, Doug Cooke -- to talk        13:07:19

         7      about the COTS program in terms of its                  13:07:23

         8      demonstration program; ask both SpaceX and              13:07:27

         9      Orbital to talk about their activities; and then        13:07:30

        10      also ask NASA/Mike Suffredini to talk about,            13:07:32

        11      now, in the follow-on, the cargo resupply               13:07:36

        12      contract that has just been awarded -- the same         13:07:39

        13      two companies involved but have Mike highlight          13:07:41

        14      the process and importance to the ISS program of        13:07:45


        15      that particular activity.                               13:07:48

        16                Then to close out, there are a couple         13:07:50

        17      of others that I would call alternative                 13:07:52

        18      architectures that have been out in the public          13:07:55

        19      eye -- the blogsphere, whatever we call                 13:08:01

        20      ourself -- for a long time, and we did want to          13:08:04

        21      have some discussion of those for the panel to          13:08:07

        22      at least introduce those ideas.                         13:08:09


                                                              157



         1                One is usually called Direct, and we          13:08:11

         2      have asked Steve Metschan to pitch for the              13:08:14

         3      Direct team.  So we'll hear that.                       13:08:19

         4                The other one is that there is a              13:08:22

         5      variety of options that can be called Shuttle C,        13:08:24

         6      Shuttle Side Mount.  The challenge of that is           13:08:27

         7      that the shuttle-derived options some years ago         13:08:29

         8      had an industry team that had been put together         13:08:34

         9      and was doing a lot of that definition but that         13:08:37

        10      had tapered off as we had proceeded down the            13:08:40

        11      baseline.  And so to try to get that on the             13:08:45

        12      table, I was in kind of an awkward situation of         13:08:47

        13      finding a spokesperson that could bring the most        13:08:50

        14      recent discussions and ideas of that.                   13:08:53

        15                So I will admit that it looks strange,        13:08:55

        16      but the person that I could twist his arm into          13:08:58

        17      doing this is John Shannon.  So I know it looks         13:09:02

        18      a little bit odd of having NASA propose an              13:09:07

        19      alternative architecture, but as it is the most         13:09:11

        20      shuttle-tied architecture, I have asked John to         13:09:14

        21      tie those pieces together, even though it               13:09:18

        22      represents lots -- a lot of different NASA and          13:09:21


                                                              158



         1      industry components.                                    13:09:23


         2                So don't read overly much into the            13:09:25

         3      fact that I browbeat John into doing that.              13:09:26

         4      That's just the best way we could get that              13:09:29

         5      option on the table.                                    13:09:31

         6                So with that, I will turn it back over        13:09:32

         7      to the Chair and ask for any opening comments,          13:09:34

         8      Norm, and then we could start with Lynn.                13:09:38

         9                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Why don't we go right         13:09:40

        10      ahead.                                                  13:09:42

        11                MS. CLINE:  Thank you.  Good                  13:09:45

        12      afternoon.  Can you bring up my charts, please.         13:09:49

        13                I was asked to represent NASA's               13:09:54

        14      current use of the Evolved Expendable Launch            13:09:57

        15      Vehicle.  Next chart, please.                           13:10:03

        16                I am going to first just put that into        13:10:05

        17      a little bit of context.                                13:10:07

        18                We have a NASA Launch Services program        13:10:09

        19      that was consolidated in 1998 at our Kennedy            13:10:12

        20      Space Center, and this is our acquisition arm           13:10:17

        21      and also provides our mission assurance and             13:10:18

        22      management for commercial launch services that          13:10:21


                                                              159



         1      NASA acquires for its missions.  We don't own           13:10:24

         2      the vehicles.  We buy commercial services in            13:10:28

         3      this case.                                              13:10:32

         4                We use a mixed fleet of vehicles,             13:10:33

         5      range of performance classes, and we support, to        13:10:36

         6      the largest degree, our Science Mission                 13:10:41

         7      Directorate with their programs but also some           13:10:45

         8      other NASA directorates.  For example, the LRO          13:10:47

         9      mission that's on the pad today is for                  13:10:52

        10      Exploration Systems Mission Directorate.  And we        13:10:55

        11      also do some launch services for other                  13:10:57

        12      government agencies.                                    13=
:11:00

        13                 We use a variety of ranges, including        13:11:01

        14      out at Kwajalein, at Wallops/Kodiak as well as          13:11:04

        15      the well-known Cape Canaveral and out at                13:11:09

        16      Vandenberg.                                             13:11:15

        17                We have a contract mechanism known as         13:11:17

        18      the NASA Launch Services contract.  This is set         13:11:19

        19      up as a competition-based contract -- proposers         13:11:22

        20      for launch services on ramp to this contract.           13:11:31

        21      We have fixed price arrangement, and as we have         13:11:36

        22      a particular mission we're ready to purchase a          13:11:38


                                                              160



         1      service for, then we do a competition based on          13:11:41

         2      the mass orbit, the class of payload and the            13:11:44

         3      best value to the government.                           13:11:50

         4                We are in the process of extending            13:11:51

         5      that contract so we have a longer ordering              13:11:54

         6      period because the current one expires next             13:11:57

         7      year.                                                   13:12:00

         8                Most recently we did a buy of launch          13:12:00

         9      services for four missions -- tracking and data         13:12:03

        10      relay satellite, the radiation belt storm probes        13:12:08

        11      and the magnetospheric multiscale mission.  All         13:12:12

        12      of those were selected to go on an Atlas V.             13:12:15

        13                Some of the issues we're facing in            13:12:20

        14      launch services is loss of medium class launch          13:12:23

        15      service providers, which has been 50 percent of         13:12:27

        16      NASA's missions historically, particularly for          13:12:30

        17      science.  We're in transition.  I'll talk about         13:12:34

        18      that in just a little bit.                              13:12:36

        19                We have a compressed manifest, and            13:12:37

        20      we're also looking to the future as how the             13:12:40

        21      infrastructure costs are shared across the              13:12:44

        22      government.  Next chart, please.                        13:12:47



                                                              161



         1                This is our current planning manifest         13:12:49

         2      that we have, and I'll just make a couple of            13:12:53

         3      general comments.  If you look at the small             13:12:56

         4      class at the top, you'll see that we have an            13:12:58

         5      oversupply of vehicles and an underutilization.         13:13:02

         6                If you look in the medium class, this         13:13:06

         7      demonstrates the transition period that we're in        13:13:10

         8      with the Delta II discontinuation.                      13:13:12

         9                And since there's a bit of a lead time        13:13:15

        10      when we put out a proposal for our science              13:13:18

        11      missions, you've seen a shift over into that            13:13:20

        12      intermediate class.  And if you look in those           13:13:23

        13      awards that we have given in that intermediate          13:13:26

        14      to heavy class, NASA is a strong user of the            13:13:29

        15      Atlas V.  Next, please.                                 13:13:34

        16                This is just a snapshot of our history        13:13:36

        17      of launches.  With regard to the expendable             13:13:42

        18      launch vehicle, NASA's first use of Atlas V was         13:13:46

        19      back in 2002 -- I'm sorry -- the first Atlas V          13:13:50

        20      was launched in 2002, and NASA's first use was          13:13:55

        21      in 2005 for the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.            13:13:58

        22                And the first use of Delta IV, NASA           13:14:03


                                                              162



         1      has not had its own mission on it, but GOES was         13:14:06

         2      on Delta IV in 2006.  And another GOES mission          13:14:10

         3      is on the pad right now for a Delta IV for a            13:14:15

         4      launch scheduled for the 26th.                          13:14:19

         5                And we've had a very, very good track         13:14:20

         6      record across our program, which was recently           13:14:23

         7      marred with the failure of a Taurus with the            13:14:26

         8      Orbiting Carbon Observatory on board.  Next,            13:14:31

         9      please.                                                 13:14:31


        10                This is really just provided to the           13:14:34

        11      committee for reference.  These are the small           13:14:36

        12      launch vehicles that are available to us to use.        13:14:38

        13      Next.                                                   13:14:42

        14                And then this is the medium to                13:14:43

        15      intermediate and heavy class vehicles, and it           13:14:46

        16      gives you a sense of the range of capabilities          13:14:49

        17      that they offer.  Next, please.                         13:14:54

        18                I want to talk a little bit about some        13:14:56

        19      considerations.                                         13:15:00

        20                Obviously for the EELV, given that            13:15:02

        21      range of vehicles, this being the highest               13:15:05

        22      performance class, it is at the high end of the         13:15:09


                                                              163



         1      cost spectrum as well.                                  13:15:12

         2                And another factor to keep in mind is         13:15:13

         3      that the Department of Defense currently covers         13:15:17

         4      the infrastructure for maintaining this EELV            13:15:22

         5      capability.  The National Space Transportation          13:15:26

         6      policy calls for a review no later than 2010 to         13:15:30

         7      evaluate the long-term requirements, funding and        13:15:35

         8      management responsibilities and infrastructure.         13:15:38

         9      So that is something that we, as a government,          13:15:41

        10      will have to address across the agencies as to          13:15:43

        11      whether the current financial base will be the          13:15:45

        12      one we continue to use or not.                          13:15:48

        13                For our science missions, going to            13:15:51

        14      EELV is required for certain missions, but it           13:15:56

        15      also in many cases is more performance than we          13:16:00

        16      actually need.  And if we use that level, not           13:16:04

        17      only do we have the higher cost of that vehicle         13:16:07

        18      but it also can increase the cost of the                13:16:10

        19      payload, particularly if they start growing to          13:16:12

        20      fill that performance capability, and the more          13:16:16


        21      we pay for launch services means the less we            13:16:18

        22      have available for science missions.  So those          13:16:21


                                                              164



         1      are very closely linked in what we can                  13:16:24

         2      accomplish in our program.                              13:16:27

         3                With regard to infrastructure, we have        13:16:29

         4      a pad on each coast for each of the EELV                13:16:35

         5      vehicles available.  We are finding recently            13:16:39

         6      that the payload processing facilities near the         13:16:42

         7      pads are limited and becoming a bit of a                13:16:45

         8      bottleneck, and we've been collectively working         13:16:49

         9      on how to deal with that.                               13:16:51

        10                With regard to the industrial base,           13:16:55

        11      I'll just say again, we have an oversupply in           13:16:58

        12      the small class.  We have some uncertainty in           13:17:00

        13      the medium class.                                       13:17:05

        14                You will hear about the Commercial            13:17:07

        15      Orbital Transportation Services program and our         13:17:11

        16      Commercial Resupply Services.  And so wearing my        13:17:12

        17      hat of overseeing the Space Station program, we         13:17:16

        18      very much want Commercial Resupply Services to          13:17:22

        19      succeed to help us to sustain the station, and          13:17:23

        20      wearing my launch services hat, I want them to          13:17:26

        21      succeed because those are very likely new medium        13:17:29

        22      class vehicles that we can use for our science          13:17:33


                                                              165



         1      missions.  So the station is becoming kind of a         13:17:35

         2      market -- initial market entry for them for us.         13:17:39

         3                There are questions in the industrial         13:17:44

         4      base about -- related to mergers and supply             13:17:46

         5      chains.  There's always a tension between having        13:17:50

         6      parallel capabilities and merging things for            13:17:54

         7      efficiency.  And the question is to what degree         13:17:58


         8      do you integrate or use the same components and         13:18:00

         9      gain those efficiencies, but then if you have a         13:18:06

        10      failure, do you have a fleet-wide impact where          13:18:10

        11      we're all grounded for a period of time.                13:18:15

        12                There's a line about multiple users           13:18:17

        13      risk approaches.  That is to say that NASA, the         13:18:20

        14      Air Force, NRO, commercial customers, we each           13:18:25

        15      have our own way of looking at and assessing            13:18:29

        16      risk for our missions and what our fallback             13:18:33

        17      options are.                                            13:18:36

        18                For NASA, we have been in the mode,           13:18:38

        19      particularly with our science missions, of              13:18:41

        20      flying unique payloads, one-of-a-kind, don't            13:18:43

        21      have a backup.  Others may be doing                     13:18:46

        22      constellations or a series of satellites so they        13:18:50


                                                              166



         1      have a different posture.  And that affects how         13:18:57

         2      we look at mission assurance, how much risk             13:19:00

         3      we're willing to accept, what kind of reviews we        13:19:02

         4      need to do.                                             13:19:06

         5                The schedule right now is a crowded           13:19:07

         6      manifest, especially for Atlas V.  And, again,          13:19:10

         7      we've been working collectively across the              13:19:14

         8      community to see what we can do to increase the         13:19:17

         9      throughput there.                                       13:19:20

        10                Just a couple of things to think about        13:19:22

        11      if one were to go down the path of doing human          13:19:25

        12      rating on EELV:  Given our use of these for all         13:19:28

        13      of these other missions and different approaches        13:19:33

        14      to risk, would there be two lines of vehicles or        13:19:37

        15      one; would there be a separate infrastructure or        13:19:43

        16      would we have to figure out how to share pads           13:19:47

        17      and processing facilities and so on; and to what        13:19:51

        18      degree would we have common systems that affect         13:19:54


        19      the fleet or different risk assessments for             13:19:57

        20      human versus robotic missions.                          13:20:00

        21                And so those are all just -- I'm not          13:20:03

        22      giving you answers.  I'm just giving you things         13:20:06


                                                              167



         1      to think about as you look at this.                     13:20:08

         2                And I provided some backup slides that        13:20:10

         3      just shows you the history of the vehicles, but         13:20:17

         4      that was all I had to present.                          13:20:20

         5                MR. BEJMUK:  Can I ask you a question,        13:20:22

         6      Lynn?                                                   13:20:24

         7                MS. CLINE:  Go ahead, Bo.                     13:20:22

         8                MR. BEJMUK:  When you talk about risk,        13:20:22

         9      do you mean like loss of mission numbers?               13:20:26

        10                MS. CLINE:  Yes.  Yes.                        13:20:31

        11                MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.                            13:20:22

        12                MS. CLINE:  Yeah.  Questions about are        13:20:32

        13      we ready to launch or not, are you willing to           13:20:33

        14      go -- do you want to go on a vehicle that has a         13:20:36

        15      long history of successful missions or are you          13:20:42

        16      willing to accept a higher risk and be a                13:20:46

        17      demonstration payload or an early payload on a          13:20:49

        18      new mission -- those kinds of things.                   13:20:53

        19                MR. BEJMUK:  Let me just follow up.           13:20:56

        20      You had done on this table on page 5, I guess,          13:20:58

        21      low, medium -- low for the risk.                        13:21:02

        22                Do you actually use numbers like LOM          13:21:05


                                                              168



         1      like -- our Constellation friends do -- or do           13:21:10

         2      you?                                                    13:21:10

         3                MS. CLINE:  We actually have a series         13:21:18

         4      of -- we go by a set of categories where once a         13:21:21

         5      vehicle has been certified to a certain category        13:21:24


         6      then we have our payloads certified to a                13:21:28

         7      particular category.                                    13:21:32

         8                So if you are, let's say, a Mars Rover        13:21:33

         9      mission that we consider very critical,                 13:21:37

        10      one-of-a-kind, put a huge investment into it,           13:21:39

        11      then we're going to want to go on a vehicle that        13:21:42

        12      has a more reliable history or has been                 13:21:44

        13      certified to a certain level.  If you are a             13:21:47

        14      payload that's in a different category that's           13:21:50

        15      willing to accept risk, then we'll match it to a        13:21:52

        16      different type of vehicle.                              13:21:56

        17                So it's not so much loss of mission           13:21:57

        18      numbers as it is trying to pair from the                13:22:00

        19      beginning which payload goes on what kind of            13:22:04

        20      vehicle.                                                13:22:07

        21                MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you.                       13:22:08

        22                MR. GREASON:  I think it's really             13:22:09


                                                              169



         1      great that you have, as an organization, worked         13:22:11

         2      out how to manage all of this risk and put, you         13:22:13

         3      know, nationally critical high value payloads on        13:22:16

         4      these launchers.                                        13:22:19

         5                How much does that mission assurance          13:22:20

         6      activity that you do contribute to the total            13:22:22

         7      cost of the mission?                                    13:22:25

         8                MS. CLINE:  That's a hard one to              13:22:27

         9      measure, I think.                                       13:22:29

        10                There was a study done a number of            13:22:31

        11      years ago that looked across NASA, Air Force and        13:22:33

        12      NRO management approaches and looked at our             13:22:37

        13      respective track records and came to the                13:22:41

        14      conclusion that we were adding value through            13:22:44

        15      that mission assurance approach, but I think            13:22:47

        16      it's always subject to some level of judgment as        13:22:50

        17      how far you go.                                         13:22:55

        18                In our contract we have put in place          13:22:56

        19      certain things where we want to just have               13:23:01

        20      insight and others where we want some stronger          13:23:04

        21      oversight, given that they're not our vehicles          13:23:09

        22      but they are our payloads.  And so I think over         13:23:12


                                                              170



         1      time we've worked through that with our                 13:23:15

         2      contractors as to what our respective roles are.        13:23:17

         3                Any other questions?                          13:23:25

         4                All right.  I'll hand off to my ULA           13:23:28

         6                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          13:23:32

         8                MR. GASS:  Thank you, Lynn, and thanks        13:23:38

         9      for those questions.  Hopefully I'll have some          13:23:41

        10      of the answers.                                         13:23:44

        11                Norm and Committee, first I'd like to         13:23:46

        12      thank you for inviting United Launch Alliance to        13:23:49

        13      speak at this public hearing.  My name is               13:23:54

        14      Michael Gass.  I'm the president and chief              13:23:54

        15      executive officer of United Launch Alliance.            13:23:52

        16                Like many who will be here before you,        13:24:00

        17      I share deep appreciation for the importance of         13:24:02

        18      human space flight for the American people and,         13:24:02

        19      indeed, the entire world.  I also share an              13:24:05

        20      awareness that we're endanger of seeing U.S.            13:24:09

        21      leadership in space exploration erode for the           13:24:11

        22      lack of clear consensus on an affordable,               13:24:13

         3                So on behalf of the 4,000 women and           13:24:21


         4      men of United Launch Alliance entrusted with the        13:24:25

         5      task of delivering spacecraft safely and                13:24:26

         6      reliably to space, I want to thank the members          13:24:26

         7      of the committee for taking on this task.  It           13:24:29

         8      will not be easy.                                       13:24:31

         9                My intention today is to share ideas          13:24:33

        10      of potential credible alternatives and to               13:24:35

        11      encourage the committee to create the forms for         13:24:38

        12      appropriate technical evaluation of the options         13:24:41

        13      and assess against affordable/sustainability to         13:24:43

        14      support our nation's priorities and acquisition         13:24:46

        15      approaches to human space flight.                       13:24:49

        16                Let me just, once again, add my               13:24:51

        17      commitment -- my personal and corporate                 13:24:53

        18      commitment that, whatever the committee's               13:24:56

        19      recommendations and the President's decisions           13:25:01

        20      are, you have ULA's full support for its                13:25:02

        21      execution.  The constancy and purpose of the            13:25:06

        22      nation of a consensus is more important than any        13:25:08

         9      infrastructure more internationally competitive.        13:26:31

        10                We have also learned that the fixed           13:26:34

        11      cost of maintaining and operating launch                13:26:36

         5      support Orion with credible cost forecasts and          13:27:19

         6      schedules based on the recent development               13:27:23

         7      experience and meet the reliability needs for           13:27:24

         8      human space flight sooner than any other                13:27:27

         9      alternative.                                            13:27:29

        10                Many of the system improvements               13:27:30

        11      contemplated for human space flight are already         13:27:32

        12      part of a planned evolution to benefit our              13:27:34

        13      national security missions that we are currently        13:27:37

        14      planning and supporting.                                13:27:40

        15                Further, we believe that Atlas V              13:27:41

        16      provides commercial crew capability to ISS and          13:27:44

        17      potentially even earlier.  We have supported            13:27:48

        18      several commercial entrepreneurs that found             13:27:50

        19      Atlas IV well suited for these potential                13:27:54

        20      ventures.  The challenge was not the technical          13:27:55

        21      solution but closing the business case in the           13:27:59

        22      inherent market and venture risk.                       13:28:01

         1                Further evolution of EELV systems and         13:28:04

         2      components provide options and flexibility to           13:28:08

         3      explore the Moon and beyond.  One of the issues         13:28:10

         4      I observed from past exploration architecture is        13:28:13

         5      the tendency to allow a point design for launch         13:28:18

         6      systems to lock you into an inflexible                  13:28:20

         7      architecture.                                           13:28:22

         8                The Atlas and Delta launch systems            13:28:23

         9      have an inherent flexibility in their design            13:28:24

        10      potential.  We have developed evolutionary              13:28:26

        11      incremental variance of these systems all of the        13:28:29


        12      way up to 100,000 metric tons plus for                  13:28:31

        13      consideration.  Not only is there vehicle               13:28:36

        14      flexibility but there's options available for           13:28:40

        15      manufacturing integration and launch operations         13:28:42

        16      to address workforce transition and unique              13:28:46

        17      requirements.                                           13:28:50

        18                ULA is prepared to support the                13:28:55

        19      committee with a thorough evaluation of all of          13:28:55

        20      these options.  So let me elaborate on some of          13:28:56

        21      these thoughts.  Next slide, please.                    13:29:00

         9      that were consolidated over the past decades            13:29:28

        10      represent this experience.  This intellectual           13:29:32

        11      capital for launch is embodied in our current           13:29:34

        16      experience of Delta IV and Atlas V were                 13:29:46

        17      developed in the last decade.  EELV systems             13:29:50

        18      represent over $4 billion of government and             13:29:54

        19      private investment that were fielded                    13:29:57

        20      approximately four years from the authority to          13:29:59

        21      proceed to their first flight.  The key theme I         13:30:01

        22      want to emphasize throughout this presentation          13:30:04

         1      is the benefit of reliability through the flight        13:30:07

         2      trials of that fleet and a robust infrastructure        13:30:10

         7      important parts.                                        13:30:26

         8                First, we believe the nation needs to         13:30:28

         9      go forth with an Orion launch capability to have        13:30:32

        10      human space capability with a                           13:30:34

        11      government-provided launch capability.                  13:30:35

        12                We also think in parallel there must          13:30:37

        13      be a commercial crew capability.  As I                  13:30:41

        14      mentioned, the Atlas and Delta are potential,           13:30:43

        15      and there's many entrepreneurs thinking about           13:30:45

        16      entering that market as well.  And it should be         13:30:48

        17      done in parallel, and the government should             13:30:50

        18      create an environment to support that.  And the         13:30:52

        19      market that should have is that support to the          13:30:54

        20      International Space Station from 2014 through           13:30:58

        21      that 2020 time frame to give that market an             13:31:00

        22      opportunity to mature.                                  13:31:04


                                                              178



         1                And on top of that, we show the third         13:31:05

         2      leg of that -- of those building blocks is the          13:31:08

         3      heavy lift variance.                                    13:31:10

         4                In the recommendations that we put            13:31:11

         5      forth is that it provides time for trade studies        13:31:13

         6      on that future architecture.  As we're focused          13:31:15

         7      on the Orion and the commercial crew getting            13:31:19

         8      capability, we have some time to hone the               13:31:19

         9      architecture and pick a flight variant that             13:31:21

        10      could be fielded to support the mission beyond          13:31:25

        11      the low Earth orbit International Space Station.        13:31:27

        12                As stated, we think that NASA could           13:31:34

        13      leverage the Delta IV EELV system to support the        13:31:36

        14      current Orion with a safe architecture, and the         13:31:38

        15      time that we've outlined on this schedule is            13:31:41

        16      equivalent to the time that we put forth for the        13:31:43

        17      entire development of three different versions          13:31:46

        18      of the Delta IV system to its first flight.             13:31:48

        19      Next slide, please.                                     13:31:53

        20                We do not pretend at ULA to be the            13:31:58

        21      nation's expert in human space flight, but we           13:32:02

        22      have been involved with NASA in Commercial Human        13:32:05


                                                              179



         1      Rating 1 studies for the past eight years.              13:32:08

         2      We've worked with commercial ventures, and we           13:32:10

         3      are an active participant with NASA on the              13:32:15


         4      Ares I-X program.                                       13:32:17

         5                We believe flight experience is key to        13:32:19

         6      human rating.  Detailed understanding of the            13:32:20

         7      system behavior and environments is -- getting          13:32:22

         8      the benefit of understanding your system margins        13:32:25

         9      and inherent risks.  With the flight experience,        13:32:27

        10      we'll be able to develop precise abort criteria         13:32:31

        11      with a robust emergency detection system that           13:32:36

        12      would fly on every mission, both human and              13:32:39

        13      non-human space flights.                                13:32:41

        14                Non-crewed missions retire the risk           13:32:44

        15      prior to that first crewed mission.                     13:32:47

        16                And I put what looks like a ruler on          13:32:49

        17      the bottom, but that's actually our flight              13:32:52

        18      experience that goes on in parallel with an             13:32:55

        19      ongoing development program.  And a lesson, when        13:32:58

        20      we developed EELV, to blend that experience of          13:33:01

        21      current flight and development expertise is +key        13:33:05

        22      to that message.                                        13:33:09

         1                Starting with a highly reliable               13:33:10

         2      system, addition of the emergency detection             13:33:13

         3      system and leveraging some of the -- some               13:33:16

         4      redundant critical flight measurements, the             13:33:17

         5      abort criteria can be developed, and matched            13:33:21

         6      with a good crew safety system, we will be able         13:33:24

         7      to deliver that safe human rating.  Next slide,         13:33:27

         8      please.                                                 13:33:27

         9                Delta IV Heavy was launched two times         13:33:33

        10      operationally with 100 percent mission success.         13:33:36

        11                The Delta IV human rating requirements        13:33:40

        12      is well understood.  I've talked about the EDS.         13:33:45

        13      We believe, as Lynn mentioned, a separate launch        13:33:48


        14      pad with a separate crew ingress and egress is          13:33:50

        15      required.  We also will have a good handle on           13:33:54

        16      some additional reliability improvements that we        13:33:56

        17      would incorporate into the vehicle, and it would        13:34:00

        18      be synergistically required with our national           13:34:01

        19      security missions.                                      13:34:04

        20                We believe there's greater than               13:34:05

        21      20 percent performance margin for both the ISS          13:34:06

        22      and lunar trajectories that allows us to provide        13:34:10


                                                              181



         1      the shaping to eliminate any concerns of black          13:34:12

         2      zones for abort criteria.                               13:34:14

         3                The DOD RS-68 engine upgrade we're            13:34:16

         4      currently working on is the enabler that                13:34:20

         5      provides this performance margin.                       13:34:24

         6                Liquid systems of EELV have the               13:34:28

         7      ability to create more benign launch and abort          13:34:32

         8      environments.  The changes to establish the             13:34:35

         9      capability are minimum, and the improvements are        13:34:38

        10      synergistic.  We think we can be available              13:34:42

        11      within four and a half years with credible cost         13:34:45

        12      estimates.  Next slide.                                 13:34:49

        13                I mentioned in the beginning about            13:34:49

        14      concept of operations, and I offered two                13:34:51

        15      examples.                                               13:34:54

        16                The two examples -- one is basically          13:34:55

        17      the maximum synergy where we do the human space         13:34:56

        18      flight utilizing the existing ULA infrastructure        13:34:59

        19      combined with the DOD program, NASA science and         13:35:02

        20      our commercial endeavors.  That's what we used          13:35:05

        21      in those cost estimates that I shared before on         13:35:08

        22      the previous slide -- is based on Example 1.            13:35:11


                                                              182



         1                Example 2 is the one that we'd look           13:35:13


         2      forward to support and to go into more detail           13:35:18

         3      about, which is about more of a separation where        13:35:21

         4      NASA has an integration and operation role of           13:35:24

         5      some unique infrastructure, and let me elaborate        13:35:27

         6      that.                                                   13:35:31

         7                But before we do, these are only two          13:35:31

         8      examples of many different ways that we could           13:35:33

         9      approach the problem, and I want to just                13:35:36

        10      highlight the Example 2 for a moment on the next        13:35:39

        11      slide.                                                  13:35:44

        12                Example 2 is highlighted here with a          13:35:45

        13      map of the United States that has three things          13:35:47

        14      identified.  The smallest dots represent                13:35:49

        15      locations of our industrial base -- the key             13:35:52

        16      suppliers for the EELV systems, critical                13:35:55

        17      resources to the success of the program.  The           13:35:58

        18      larger red dots represent the locations of our          13:36:00

        19      ULA facilities.  And the yellow stars represent         13:36:04

        20      some additional facilities we would recommend in        13:36:08

        21      relationship to this approach.                          13:36:12

        22                The approach that we would recommend          13:36:13


                                                              183



         1      that we maintain detailed part fabrication and          13:36:15

         2      tank manufacturing in our Decatur, Alabama              13:36:21

         3      facility with use of a common supply chain from         13:36:24

         4      that industrial base that's represented here.           13:36:27

         5                We would recommend that NASA establish        13:36:29

         6      an engineering leadership team at the Marshall          13:36:30

         7      Space Flight Center which is only about 15,             13:36:34

         8      20 miles from our Decatur facility to make sure         13:36:36

         9      they're the focus for the human rating elements         13:36:36

        10      and the integration of the Orion vehicle.               13:36:39

        11                We believe, when looking at the               13:36:41


        12      overall constraints and needs of the program, an        13:36:42

        13      additional area would be required for a final           13:36:45

        14      assembly of this vehicle.  We'd hope it would           13:36:48

        15      have the same underlying technical baseline but         13:36:52

        16      providing two assembly areas for production             13:36:58

        17      rate, and utilizing existing facilities like            13:36:59

        18      NASA's Michoud facility is recommended on this          13:37:00

        19      slide.                                                  13:37:04

        20                The third element is, again, that             13:37:04

        21      launch complex.  Whether it's Launch Complex 37A        13:37:07

        22      adjacent to our existing launch complex or              13:37:11


                                                              184



         1      utilizing 39 should be evaluated carefully for          13:37:16

         2      best operational activity.                              13:37:19

         3                One of the things we talk about many          13:37:21

         4      times when we talk about synergism and this             13:37:22

         5      approach is the efficiency of use of resources,         13:37:26

         6      and resources typically is about dollars.  I            13:37:29

         7      want to emphasize the importance of the human           13:37:31

         8      capital resource of our nation, and we need to          13:37:36

         9      find a way to be able to harness the expertise          13:37:37

        10      and find jobs on this program to ensure the             13:37:41

        11      appropriate transition of that experience               13:37:42

        12      resource as well as creating the opportunity for        13:37:45

        13      the next generation.  And this would enable some        13:37:48

        14      of those great opportunities.  Next slide.              13:37:51

        15                We talked a little bit about EELV for         13:37:55

        16      commercial human space.  Again, we believe the          13:37:59

        17      requirements are well understood.  We've been           13:38:01

        18      working with several of the companies, and they         13:38:03

        19      were nice enough to let us use their pictures of        13:38:06

        20      their potential spacecraft.  And we gave credit         13:38:09

        21      for them at the bottom of the slide.                    13:38:14

        22                I would want to also acknowledge that         13:38:18



                                                              185



         1      United Launch Alliance, as part of our consent          13:38:20

         2      order and master agreement, we're in the launch         13:38:24

         3      vehicle business.  We cannot be a provider of           13:38:25

         4      that upper stage in service.  We can launch             13:38:28

         5      services to companies that want to be the prime         13:38:30

         6      for that service and build those spacecrafts.           13:38:33

         7                So being a merchant supplier of               13:38:37

         8      launch, we're capable of working with many              13:38:40

         9      teams.  We believe we can offer them a low              13:38:42

        10      non-recurring opportunity.  Again, if human             13:38:45

        11      space flight is coming on to the extended launch        13:38:47

        12      vehicle, we'd recommend a second launch pad and,        13:38:48

        13      with increased rate, have a competitive or              13:38:51

        14      affordable cost.                                        13:38:55

        15                Again, as Lynn mentioned, the                 13:38:57

        16      characterization from numerous flights both for         13:39:02

        17      NASA, the DOD, the intelligence community and           13:39:06

        18      some commercial spacecraft provides the data to         13:39:09

        19      characterize for future flight safety.                  13:39:12

        20                EELV and the launch vehicle itself is         13:39:16

        21      not on the critical path to this activity.  We          13:39:23

        22      believe we could have the vehicle ready long            13:39:24


                                                              186



         1      before the development and qualification of             13:39:26

         2      those spacecraft that you see depicted.                 13:39:28

         3                Again, the challenge for ULA and the          13:39:31

         4      potential commercial operators is the                   13:39:33

         5      non-recurring implementation costs for both             13:39:35

         6      spacecraft development and launch vehicle               13:39:39

         7      integration and our EELV recurring costs.  We           13:39:41

         8      are working with our DOD, NRO and NASA customers        13:39:47

         9      to buy launches more efficiently for government         13:39:49


        10      use and which would enable better value for the         13:39:52

        11      potential domestic commercial ventures.  Next           13:39:56

        12      slide, please.                                          13:40:00

        13                I talked about the evolution of a             13:40:00

        14      flexible -- that enables a flexible mission             13:40:03

        15      architecture.  This was a chart that was started        13:40:06

        16      doing some studies with NASA back in the                13:40:09

        17      2003-2004 time frame that we've further honed           13:40:14

        18      after we became United Launch Alliance.  The            13:40:16

        19      initial studies were done as two independent            13:40:18

        20      program teams.                                          13:40:20

        21                We joked when we were forming ULA that        13:40:21

        22      we'd up with the Franken rocket, and lo and             13:40:23


                                                              187



         1      behold, it's becoming -- it's coming truth that         13:40:26

         2      there's a best of both qualities that are being         13:40:28

         3      integrated in our future evolution.                     13:40:32

         4                The important messages of this chart          13:40:35

         5      is the modularity of the approach, that there's         13:40:38

         6      different break points and opportunities for            13:40:41

         7      different architectures, that all of the steps          13:40:44

         8      have value to all of the customers and that             13:40:46

         9      there be flight used on many of our current             13:40:50

        10      NRO/DOD missions.                                       13:40:56

        11                The first step that we always                 13:40:57

        12      highlight is the upper stage.  It's the area            13:40:58

        13      that can give us more performance, more                 13:41:00

        14      reliability, and the development of a common            13:41:01

        15      upper stage with either improved RL-10 or a new         13:41:03

        16      upper stage engine is something first and               13:41:08

        17      foremost in our road map.                               13:41:13

        18                The areas in blue are things that we          13:41:16

        19      could do using the existing launch                      13:41:18

        20      infrastructure and current engine systems.              13=
:41:19

        21                The orange, which we call Phrase 3,           13:41:21

        22      represents things that would require new launch         13:41:23


                                                              188



         1      infrastructure and, you know, the brick and             13:41:25

         2      mortar of launch pads, flame buckets, and all of        13:41:27

         3      the GSC is the expensive non-recurring element          13:41:32

         4      and would need new propulsion systems.                  13:41:34

         5                The key message for all of this is            13:41:39

         6      that there are choices and that there is synergy        13:41:41

         7      in its use.  Next slide.                                13:41:45

         8                We believe human space flight on EELV         13:41:47

         9      could potentially enhance safety, lower costs by        13:41:54

        10      enhancing and leveraging the flight tempo of the        13:41:57

        11      existing programs.                                      13:42:01

        12                Accelerating we also believe we could         13:42:04

        13      accelerate initial capabilities to support the          13:42:07

        14      utilization of the International Space Station.         13:42:10

        15                We can enable -- if we do develop             13:42:14

        16      those savings, enable those resources to be             13:42:16

        17      applied to supporting missions to the Moon and          13:42:19

        18      other destinations beyond low Earth orbit.              13:42:22

        19                We believe the right policy and the           13:42:24

        20      right acquisition strategies will stimulate             13:42:26

        21      commercial space flight capabilities.                   13:42:29

        22                And we think we have provided options         13:42:32


                                                              189



         1      to address workforce transition and unique              13:42:35

         2      operational requirements of human space flight.         13:42:38

         3                Again, we are prepared to support the         13:42:40

         4      committee and NASA with the detail data for the         13:42:42

         5      evaluations.  I encourage an open and thorough          13:42:45

         6      evaluation of options which will lead to the            13:42:48

         7      best solution for the nation, and I thank you           13:42:50


         8      for your leadership in doing that.                      13:42:52

         9                I'd be available to answer questions.         13:42:55

        10                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  Thank you very         13:42:57

        11      much.  I think we have time for one or two              13:42:58

        12      questions, if folks have them.                          13:43:01

        13                Okay.  Leroy and then Wanda.                  13:43:06

        14                MR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  Thanks very much           13:43:06

        15      for your presentation.                                  13:43:08

        16                I was interested in some of the points        13:43:09

        17      you made, and, in fact, in the summary page you         13:43:11

        18      said you were going to enhance safety and lower         13:43:14

        19      costs.  And I don't know if you saw the                 13:43:17

        20      morning's presentation from the NASA folks, but         13:43:20

        21      it seems to run counter to what they're saying          13:43:22

        22      about their Ares family.                                13:43:24


                                                              190



         1                I wonder if you could comment on that.        13:43:25

         2                MR. GASS:  I did not get to see the           13:43:28

         3      presentation, and that's -- that's fundamentally        13:43:30

         4      the comment about open and thorough                     13:43:32

         5      evaluation -- clearly need to have their                13:43:35

         6      expertise of what's in the reliability, their           13:43:38

         7      numbers and assessments.  The aerospace team            13:43:41

         8      done theirs.                                            13:43:45

         9                To date all of these studies have been        13:43:46

        10      done compartmentalized, and I think just getting        13:43:48

        11      all of the experts in a room and with the               13:43:50

        12      committee's oversight would get at the heart of         13:43:53

        13      some of those questions.                                13:43:55

        14                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Wanda.                        13:43:57

        15                DR. AUSTIN:  Hi, Mike.  You showed a          13:44:01

        16      chart that indicated you've got suppliers across        13:44:03

        17      the country, and one of the concerns that has           13:44:05


        18      been raised to us is about the industrial base.         13:44:07

        19                Can you make a few comments about --          13:44:10

        20      in your summary chart you did not address that.         13:44:12

        21      Could you say a few words about what the impact         13:44:15

        22      would be.                                               13:44:18


                                                              191



         1                MR. GASS:  Absolutely, Dr. Austin.            13:44:19

         2      Thank you for that question, and I apologize for        13:44:22

         3      omitting it.                                            13:44:22

         4                The number one thing that I talk              13:44:23

         5      about -- and as a matter of fact, at this               13:44:23

         6      morning's meeting with the intelligence                 13:44:26

         7      community and the Department of Defense, we were        13:44:27

         8      talking about the focus on the industrial base.         13:44:28

         9      It really is fragile.  It's fragile for many            13:44:31

        10      reasons, one of which is the work of this               13:44:37

        11      committee.  Without the knowledge and commitment        13:44:39

        12      of a human space flight, nobody is investing,           13:44:42

        13      nobody is basically planning it into their -- to        13:44:46

        14      the future.                                             13:44:49

        15                We already know about the budget              13:44:49

        16      constraints of the nation, spending in the              13:44:51

        17      Department of Defense.  But fundamentally things        13:44:54

        18      are getting really lean in some of those major          13:44:56

        19      factories.                                              13:44:59

        20                We encourage the use of expendable            13:45:01

        21      launch vehicles as a strategic program.  It does        13:45:07

        22      have some key needs over the next ten years, and        13:45:07


                                                              192



         1      the nation right now is not even using its --           13:45:07

         2      that capability strategically.  We're buying            13:45:10

         3      launches one at a time.  So we're not able to           13:45:13

         4      use EELV to give some anchor tenancy in some of         13:45:16

         5      those supplier base and the knowledge for them          13:45:20


         6      to either make investments.                             13:45:21

         7                The other thing that's going on in the        13:45:24

         8      supplier base is an overcapacity.  We sill have         13:45:26

         9      an overcapacity in many of our facilities.  We          13:45:28

        10      have a challenge.  As a nation, we love our             13:45:31

        11      competition and have lots of competitors                13:45:35

        12      domestically.  But in this industry we're               13:45:36

        13      dealing is international competition.                   13:45:38

        14                We need to make a decision -- is our          13:45:40

        15      competition the global competitors or are we            13:45:43

        16      looking to compete internally in this nation.           13:45:46

        17      If we do that, we're going to dilute our                13:45:50

        18      industrial base by spreading it around to lots          13:45:52

        19      of suppliers that don't have enough business to         13:45:52

        20      keep the robust processes that you need for             13:45:56

        21      space flight.                                           13:45:58

        22                DR. AUSTIN:  All right.  Thank you,           13:45:58

         1      Mike.                                                   13:45:58

         2                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Let's do one more             13:45:58

         3      question.  Bo...                                        13:46:03

         4                MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you for your               13:46:03

         5      terrific presentation, but I have one question          13:46:04

         6      that has to do with the mainstay of structural          13:46:07

         7      design in human systems that I've been exposed          13:46:11

         8      to for many years has been use 1.4 safety               13:46:14

         9      factor -- structural safety factor.                     13:46:18

        10                Is Delta IV and Atlas V designed to a         13:46:21

        11      1.4 safety factor, and if not, how would you            13:46:25

        12      overcome that, you know, challenge?                     13:46:29

        13                MR. GASS:  The answer, Bo, you're on          13:46:32

        14      the right -- and I think we're consistent with          13:46:32

        15      all of those activities, and to some -- as Lynn         13:46:34


        16      was showing in our criteria, those are some of          13:46:36

        17      the kinds of criteria you have in those mature          13:46:39

        18      systems.                                                13:46:42

        19                We have a 2.0 factor of safety in             13:46:42

        20      design margin if it's untested.  We use 1.4 and         13:46:43

        21      1.25, depending on its testing environment in           13:46:45

        22      some of the different -- the modes it's in.  But        13:46:49


                                                              194



         1      clearly using the industry standards of 2.0 for         13:46:52

         2      untested structure and 1.4 for tested is kind of        13:46:52

         3      our mantra.  And if we take exception to it,            13:46:57

         4      it's noted with risk, and we have the                   13:46:59

         5      appropriate mitigations on that.                        13:47:01

         6                So we think our system is well                13:47:03

         7      characterized, well understood on those margins         13:47:06

         8      on not only structure but on every component            13:47:09

         9      throughout the system.                                  13:47:11

        10                MR. GREASON:  Can I throw one more in         13:47:16

        11      there?                                                  13:47:16

        12                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  One last one.          13:47:13

        13                MR. GREASON:  I'll be quick.                  13:47:16

        14                Among the industrial base concerns is,        13:47:18

        15      you know, what we do for ongoing development            13:47:22

        16      capability for large liquid rocket engines.  I          13:47:24

        17      notice that, you know, in your future growth            13:47:27

        18      plan you've got the potential for putting dual          13:47:29

        19      RD-180's on the Atlas V.                                13:47:32

        20                Have you looked at all at what it             13:47:36

        21      would take to do, you know, a modern                    13:47:38

        22      F-1/RD-180/RD-170 class replacement to -- as an         13:47:39


                                                              195



         1      alternative to just putting more of those on?           13:47:42

         2                MR. GASS:  Yes, Jeff, and thanks for          13:47:45

         3      that question.                                          13:47:47


         4                The number one issue for space flight         13:47:49

         5      is -- if you will, it's not United Launch               13:47:51

         6      Alliance with the system private.  It's our             13:47:55

         7      propulsion industry and our propulsion                  13:48:00

         8      capability.                                             13:48:00

         9                The fact that our nation does not have        13:48:01

        10      a LOX hydrocarbon engine capability is a                13:48:01

        11      problem, and if there was that extra investment         13:48:07

        12      dollar, that is a key resource across NASA's            13:48:10

        13      civil and DOD that we need to invest in it.             13:48:14

        14      From a commercial standpoint, if you will, the          13:48:17

        15      business case doesn't close.  The crossover             13:48:20

        16      point is great.                                         13:48:22

        17                We have looked at not only domestic --        13:48:25

        18      doing it alone, we've looked at joint                   13:48:26

        19      partnerships with joint developments.  You had,         13:48:29

        20      I think, Mr. Perminov on from the Russian               13:48:32

        21      Roscosmos earlier.  We worked with his team on a        13:48:35

        22      potential of kind of an RD-181 joint development        13:48:38


                                                              196



         1      activity as well as other international                 13:48:40

         2      partnerships.                                           13:48:42

         3                But LOX hydrogen for a first stage            13:48:42

         4      booster has been studied over and over again,           13:48:46

         5      and it comes out the right answer.  And the fact        13:48:48

         6      that we don't have a good robust domestic               13:48:51

         7      capability is a problem.                                13:48:54

         8                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          13:48:55

         9      We appreciate your comments.                            13:48:56

        10                Let's see.  I think the Aerospace             13:48:58

        11      presentation is next, if I'm not mistaken.              13:49:04

        12                Gary...                                       13:49:10

        13                MR. PULLIAM:  Good afternoon,                 13:49:10


        14      Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee.  My          13:49:12

        15      name is Gary Pulliam, and I'm pleased to present        13:49:13

        16      to you today the initial look in to Aerospace           13:49:16

        17      Corporation's work on this important subject.           13:49:22

        18                A word about Aerospace, we are a              13:49:23

        19      California-based, not-for-profit company formed         13:49:23

        20      in June 1960, 49 years ago this month, to               13:49:26

        21      provide technical and scientific support to             13:49:30

        22      Air Force and other government and space                13:49:33


                                                              197



         1      programs.  And that's the job we've been doing          13:49:35

         2      for those 49 years.  We've been a strong partner        13:49:37

         3      with the Air Force and a strong partner with            13:49:41

         4      NASA for many, many years, and we're proud of           13:49:43

         5      that fact.                                              13:49:46

         6                With regard to this particular piece          13:49:46

         7      of work that NASA has asked us to do, we've been        13:49:48

         8      looking at the subject matter of the EELV system        13:49:50

         9      as a replacement for part of the Constellation          13:49:54

        10      profile for some time, even before it became a          13:49:58

        11      profile.  We began an initial look back in 2005         13:50:01

        12      after the President had announced his vision but        13:50:05

        13      before the architecture was well understood.            13:50:09

        14      And at that point we were simply asked to               13:50:11

        15      determine whether or not the EELV could be human        13:50:13

        16      ratable, and at that time we decided and                13:50:14

        17      determined, yes, it could be.                           13:50:15

        18                Then NASA came out with its                   13:50:17

        19      architecture and proceeded along those                  13:50:20

        20      developmental paths.  Then about three years            13:50:22

        21      later, late last year, we were asked to look at         13:50:25

        22      it again.                                               13:50:27


                                                              198



         1                Now that NASA had begun its                   13:50:28


         2      development of its programs and now that the            13:50:30

         3      EELV, particularly the Delta IV, had flown and          13:50:33

         4      now that NASA had implemented some of its own           13:50:37

         5      policies with regard to human rating factors and        13:50:39

         6      other matters, we were asked to come back and           13:50:40

         7      take another look at the state of information           13:50:45

         8      regarding human rating of the EELV.  And we             13:50:46

         9      presented that information to the NASA                  13:50:48

        10      headquarters to Dr. Griffin and staff in                13:50:50

        11      December.                                               13:50:50

        12                And then following that, we were given        13:50:54

        13      this final task, which is the last bullet there.        13:50:55

        14      Next chart, please.                                     13:50:57

        15                And the scope of that study was now to        13:50:58

        16      get a bit more precise and to look at the               13:51:02

        17      programmatic and technical feasibility of using         13:51:04

        18      a Delta IV Heavy in lieu of the Ares I mission          13:51:07

        19      and specifically to look at that in the context         13:51:11

        20      of the overall effects on the Constellation             13:51:13

        21      architecture.  And that's a really important            13:51:15

        22      point for our work.                                     13:51:17


                                                              199



         1                We looked at the capability of using          13:51:18

         2      the Delta IV Heavy in lieu of the Ares I to take        13:51:21

         3      humans to low Earth orbit and what that means to        13:51:25

         4      the rest of the Constellation and the intended          13:51:29

         5      mission of taking humans beyond low Earth orbit.        13:51:31

         6                So we did not look at alternatives to         13:51:33

         7      the job that NASA has been given.  We did not           13:51:36

         8      look at alternatives to the architecture.  Our          13:51:38

         9      study assumed that you want to leave low Earth          13:51:43

        10      orbit, and to do that, you need a big rocket and        13:51:45

        11      the big rocket of record is the Ares V.                 13:51:47


        12                We also did not assess the confidence         13:51:50

        13      levels or the executability of the current              13:51:53

        14      Ares I cost and schedule.  We took the program          13:51:56

        15      of record and the progress that was initially           13:51:59

        16      established for that program and used those for         13:51:59

        17      comparability purposes.                                 13:52:04

        18                As we began to look at those, we came         13:52:04

        19      up with several options.  First, we started with        13:52:06

        20      the Delta IV baseline program, which is not             13:52:08

        21      presently human rated, and then we began to look        13:52:13

        22      at excursions around that to bound our study.           13:52:15


                                                              200



         1                In option No. 2 we looked at taking           13:52:19

         2      the Ares I upper stage and its J-2X engine and          13:52:21

         3      using those on a Delta IV.  We realized that the        13:52:25

         4      J-2X engine, as being currently designed, has a         13:52:28

         5      good deal more thrust than this application             13:52:31

         6      would need.                                             13:52:34

         7                So that led us to an Option No. 3             13:52:35

         8      where we would still use the Ares I upper stage         13:52:38

         9      with its engine but at a reduced, resized level         13:52:41

        10      of thrust to be more appropriate for the mission        13:52:44

        11      at hand.                                                13:52:47

        12                Then we began to look at other kinds          13:52:48

        13      of upper stages in Option 4.  We looked at a            13:52:49

        14      redesigned upper stage with a cluster of four           13:52:51

        15      RL-10 engines, and then we looked at could you          13:52:54

        16      do this mission with no upper stage at all, just        13:52:57

        17      using the Orion service module for final                13:53:01

        18      maneuvering, and then finally what about the            13:53:05

        19      HR -- human-rated Delta IV with just a single           13:53:08

        20      RL-10 engine.                                           13:53:11

        21                We did not look at the Atlas V simply         13:53:11

        22      because the Delta IV Heavy was farther along.           13:53:13


                                                              201



         1      It had flown.  We had more comparative data.  So        13:53:16

         2      we concentrated our work at NASA's direction on         13:53:19

         3      the comparison of Delta IV Heavy to the Ares I          13:53:23

         4      program.                                                13:53:25

         5                As we completed this study, here are          13:53:27

         6      some of the top level key findings that we had.         13:53:29

         7      First of all, as we understood how NASA was             13:53:32

         8      implementing the human rating requirements into         13:53:35

         9      the Ares I program, we were better able to make         13:53:38

        10      a determination about how these might flow into         13:53:40

        11      a human-rated Delta IV program, and we tried to         13:53:43

        12      get as precise as we could and as comparable as         13:53:47

        13      we could as we made determinations about the            13:53:50

        14      Delta IV human rating program.                          13:53:53

        15                The configurations that have either           13:53:56


        16      the J-2X engine as the upper stage or RL-10             13:53:58

        17      derivatives are feasible, and they have                 13:54:03

        18      significant margin in terms of cost -- in terms         13:54:05

        19      of performance to both the International Space          13:54:06

        20      Station point and to the LEO point for the lunar        13:54:10

        21      mission, which is a bit more demanding.                 13:54:13

        22                We also looked at the Delta IV human          13:54:16


                                                              202



         1      rated with one single RL-10 derivative engine.          13:54:19

         2      We found that it meets the Ares I performance           13:54:23

         3      margins, but it is closer, as you would                 13:54:26

         4      expect -- one engine instead of a cluster of            13:54:29

         5      four engines, but we did find that it had               13:54:32

         6      sufficient gross margin performance for that            13:54:35

         7      mission.                                                13:54:38

         8                But we suggest that if the committee          13:54:39

         9      is interested in that particular option that we         13:54:40

        10      need to be more precise and more work is                13:54:43

        11      required on the exact profiling of the launch           13:54:46

        12      and the ascent profiles and the performance             13:54:50

        13      margins to those very important targets.                13:54:53

        14                We looked at briefly at the no upper          13:54:56

        15      stage configuration using the Orion Service             13:54:58

        16      Module, and our estimation and our findings are         13:54:59

        17      that while it could make performance to the ISS         13:55:03

        18      target we didn't think it could make performance        13:55:05

        19      to the lunar target, which has a bit more               13:55:09

        20      up-mass requirements.  So that was our findings         13:55:10

        21      on that.  Next chart.                                   13:55:12

        22                As we looked at the Constellation             13:55:14


                                                              203



         1      impacts piece on this possible trade, we believe        13:55:18

         2      that industry can accommodate whatever increase         13:55:20

         3      in production might come from moving the Ares I         13:55:23


         4      into the Delta IV EELV human-rated family.              13:55:36

         5      However, we're quick to point out that the              13:55:36

         6      industrial base includes the large solid rocket         13:55:36

         7      motor industrial base, and that becomes a               13:55:39

         8      concern as we thought about the overall                 13:55:39

         9      architecture at large.                                  13:55:41

        10                We recognized the Delta IV Heavy can          13:55:44

        11      use some of the existing Ares I hardware                13:55:47

        12      infrastructure -- ground processing and                 13:55:47

        13      infrastructure, and we tried to take of                 13:55:52

        14      advantage of that in our assessments wherever we        13:55:54

        15      could.                                                  13:55:58

        16                You just heard from ULA that they             13:55:58

        17      preferred SLC 37A.  That would work.  We                13:56:00

        18      actually preferred SLC 39 a bit more, but both          13:56:04

        19      of those options are attainable, depending on           13:56:06

        20      which way you wanted to go and how you worked           13:56:08

        21      the ground processing piece.                            13:56:11

        22                The Aerospace recommended option is           13:56:15


                                                              204



         1      for the human-rated Delta IV Heavy with a               13:56:15

         2      cluster of four resigned RL-10 engines.  That           13:56:16

         3      gives an engine-out ability, which we think is          13:56:20

         4      important, and it allows a different kind of            13:56:23

         5      thrusting and orbit insertion and a different           13:56:26

         6      kind of thrust level than you would need with           13:56:29

         7      only one engine.  And that became our                   13:56:31

         8      recommended option among the six we looked at.          13:56:33

         9                It is important to recognize as               13:56:36

        10      well -- and this plays into the remainder of our        13:56:38

        11      findings -- once you make that decision to go           13:56:40

        12      with any combination of RL-10 engines assuming,         13:56:42

        13      as we did, that the Constellation program is            13:56:47


        14      still the program of record, which means that           13:56:51

        15      you need a big rocket and that big rocket is the        13:56:54

        16      Ares V.                                                 13:56:56

        17                Now you have to deal with what are you        13:56:57

        18      going to do about the solid rocket motor                13:56:58

        19      industrial base and who's going to take care of         13:57:00

        20      the J-2X engine development.  As you would              13:57:03

        21      appropriately determine, because both the Ares I        13:57:07

        22      and the Ares V use the J-2X engine, then those          13:57:11


                                                              205



         1      developmental costs are borne by the Ares I             13:57:13

         2      program.                                                13:57:14

         3                So if that went away, now that burden         13:57:15

         4      of developing that engine shifts over to the            13:57:18

         5      Ares V program, and we'll see that when our cost        13:57:21

         6      findings show up here in just a minute.  Next           13:57:23

         7      chart.                                                  13:57:23

         8                So the story now moves from the               13:57:26

         9      technical ability to use a Delta IV Heavy human         13:57:28

        10      rated in a number of configurations to                  13:57:31

        11      accomplish the mission then and then to what            13:57:37

        12      does it mean to the Constellation at large.             13:57:39

        13                So we start out with the idea of we're        13:57:42

        14      talking about 14 flights to LEO, to the ISS and         13:57:45

        15      lunar orbit targets, and we're presuming that           13:57:47

        16      NASA's job is to still take humans beyond low           13:57:53

        17      Earth orbit to accomplish the Moon mission and          13:57:53

        18      eventually the Mars mission.  So, again, we did         13:57:57

        19      not attempt to change that architecture at all.         13:57:58

        20                If you went with one upper stage --           13:58:02

        21      one RL-10 engine upper stage and delivery to            13:58:04

        22      those two orbits, we believe that you could save        13:58:08


                                                              206



         1      about $6 billion relative to the Ares I program         13:58:12


         2      of record.  Remember that we believe the                13:58:17

         3      performance margins there are a bit closer than         13:58:19

         4      they would be with our recommendation of four           13:58:22

         5      RL-10's.                                                13:58:24

         6                If you move into our recommendation of        13:58:25

         7      the four RL-10's, we find the savings to be             13:58:28

         8      about $3 billion from the Ares I program of             13:58:31

         9      record.                                                 13:58:36

        10                And if you decide you're really going         13:58:36

        11      to use the Ares I upper stage with the J-2X             13:58:37

        12      engine on top of the human-rated Delta IV, we           13:58:37

        13      think the cost comes out about the same in that         13:58:42

        14      trade.                                                  13:58:44

        15                But immediately one must recognize for        13:58:45

        16      all of those options there are some increases in        13:58:49

        17      the present cost profile for the Ares V program.        13:58:51

        18      Particularly if you choose an option that does          13:58:55

        19      not have the J-2X engine, then those costs are          13:58:55

        20      going to shift to the Ares V program and have to        13:58:59

        21      be borne by it in order to have the J-2X engine         13:59:01

        22      ready for that rocket.                                  13:59:06


                                                              207



         1                So we find that those cost uppers for         13:59:07

         2      the Ares V program would be somewhere between           13:59:10

         3      1.1 and that $3.6 billion, depending on which of        13:59:13

         4      these other options you choose and period of            13:59:16

         5      implementation and some of those details.               13:59:18

         6                If one cancels the Ares I program,            13:59:21

         7      NASA asserts to Aerospace -- and it was a given         13:59:25

         8      in our study -- that it has to add back a               13:59:29

         9      substantial amount of funding in order to               13:59:32

        10      accomplish the Constellation architecture               13:59:34

        11      mission as originally given to them.                    13:59:40


        12                You can see in the final bullets              13:59:42

        13      there, there are elements of that number that           13:59:44

        14      NASA has given to us of between 14 and                  13:59:48

        15      $16 billion.  There are industrial-based issues         13:59:52

        16      there.  There are sustainment of the workforce          13:59:54

        17      issues.  There are the increased costs of               13:59:59

        18      development of the J-2X if you're now not doing         14:00:01

        19      that under the Ares I program.                          14:00:04

        20                We've called one of those elements in         14:00:06

        21      the middle bullet there about increased DDT&E           14:00:09

        22      cost to the Ares V program.  Those costs might          14:00:09


                                                              208



         1      be partially or perhaps even fully accounted for        14:00:14

         2      in NASA's number, but the point is NASA has             14:00:16

         3      confirmed that if we went to the Delta IV Heavy         14:00:20

         4      they believe at this moment that they would have        14:00:24

         5      a requirement for this much additional money            14:00:27

         6      back into the program to accomplish the mission         14:00:30

         7      they've been given.  Next chart, please.                14:00:33

         8                With regard to schedule, we believe           14:00:34

         9      that human rating of the Delta IV is on the             14:00:37

        10      order of 5.5 to 7 years.  That is Aerospace's           14:00:41

        11      conservative estimate.  No doubt there's some           14:00:41

        12      time in there to get started.  The go-ahead for         14:00:49

        13      that would certainly not be today.  And we've           14:00:49

        14      done conservative things, as you would expect us        14:00:54

        15      to do, as we contemplated historical times for          14:00:56

        16      human development activity, and we believe it's         14:00:59

        17      in the range of 5-1/2 to 7 years.                       14:01:01

        18                We did not compare that and a date on         14:01:04

        19      a calendar to what Ares I is doing.  We accept          14:01:06

        20      the IOC as presently given for the Ares I               14:01:10

        21      program, and this is simply a statement of how          14:01:13

        22      long we think this program would take.                  14:01:17


                                                              209



         1                We think the ground facilities and the        14:01:17

         2      launch vehicle and components actually are              14:01:17

         3      pretty close to their critical path.  Both of           14:01:20

         4      them are going to take some amount of time.  We         14:01:22

         5      think Orion need not be on the critical path            14:01:25

         6      because it's farther along, and if you want to          14:01:28

         7      redesign a new upper stage, you can shift the           14:01:29

         8      preponderance of that technical burden over to          14:01:33

         9      the new upper stage and try to disrupt Orion as         14:01:35

        10      little as possible.  So we think there's a way          14:01:40

        11      to work that.                                           14:01:43

        12                With regard to the Ares V schedule,           14:01:44

        13      it, again, depends on programmatic and program          14:01:44

        14      management activities.  With more time for the          14:01:47

        15      Ares V program, the schedule actually could be          14:01:51


        16      positively impacted.  But if on the other hand          14:01:54

        17      NASA were to cancel the Ares I program and wait         14:01:57

        18      a long time before it turned its attention to           14:02:02

        19      the Ares V program, there could actually be             14:02:06

        20      damage.  So the opportunities there exist to            14:02:07

        21      actually help the Ares V schedule.                      14:02:10

        22                We see nothing inherent about using a         14:02:12


                                                              210



         1      Delta IV Heavy that detracts from the Ares V            14:02:12

         2      schedule other than one now needs to really pay         14:02:16

         3      close attention to this industrial base issue to        14:02:19

         4      make sure those capabilities are there for you          14:02:22

         5      when you need them.                                     14:02:23

         6                The same thing with the Orion                 14:02:25

         7      schedule.  NASA has indicated to us that if you         14:02:26

         8      move the Orion over to a new or redesigned upper        14:02:29

         9      stage it might take as much as a year to                14:02:32

        10      revalidate, recertify, requalify the interfaces.        14:02:39

        11      Even if you're not redesigning that capsule, you        14:02:39

        12      need to now make sure it's going to fit on the          14:02:43

        13      new upper stage that you've decided to do if you        14:02:45

        14      put it on a Delta IV instead of the Ares                14:02:48

        15      vehicle.                                                14:02:51

        16                And we would say that in all cases, if        14:02:52

        17      such a decision were made, those decisions need         14:02:54

        18      to happen immediately so that planning can begin        14:02:57

        19      and long lead items can occur and all of the            14:03:00

        20      things that would be required not to have that          14:03:03

        21      schedule slip.                                          14:03:06

        22                We were also asked to contemplate what        14:03:07


                                                              211



         1      the effects might be on National Security Space.        14:03:10

         2      And, again, it could be positive, and it could          14:03:13

         3      be detrimental, depending on your point of view.        14:03:14


         4                Certainly more production of EELVs for        14:03:18

         5      more than one customer would serve to bolster           14:03:22

         6      supplier chain robustness.  It would have the           14:03:27

         7      opportunity to bring down costs for all                 14:03:30

         8      customers potentially.  It perhaps would get            14:03:32

         9      suppliers and factories running back closer to          14:03:36

        10      the kinds of capabilities and capacities they           14:03:36

        11      had in mind when they designed those.                   14:03:38

        12                On the other hand, as was mentioned by        14:03:40

        13      both previous briefers, you could wind up with          14:03:43

        14      two configurations of the Delta IV Heavy in the         14:03:47

        15      same plant.  One would have to understand what          14:03:48

        16      differences those make -- if the human-rated            14:03:51

        17      Delta IV is a slightly different vehicle than           14:03:52

        18      the non-human rated -- and those issues would           14:03:55

        19      have to be managed.  We think they could be and         14:03:58

        20      that would be easily accommodated.                      14:04:01

        21                You could wind up with a single               14:04:03

        22      vehicle that accommodates both users, and one           14:04:05

         1      would have to really understand what the payload        14:04:07

         2      capacity is for that vehicle in light of all of         14:04:10

         3      the missions that it now has to do on behalf of         14:04:13

         4      the National Security Space programs.                   14:04:16

         5                We think that the idea of National            14:04:21

         6      Security Space and NASA working alongside could         14:04:23

         7      be managed to the good of the nation, but it            14:04:26

         8      would be something that everyone would need to          14:04:30

         9      pay attention to.                                       14:04:32

        10                And we think the pad and range issues,        14:04:33

        11      regardless of which pad you go to, are                  14:04:36

        12      manageable and doable as both presenters prior          14:04:40

        13      to me have indicated.                                   14:04:43


        14                So finally, just to reiterate, the            14:04:45

        15      Constellation architecture as designed by NASA          14:04:49

        16      in 2005 is an architecture, and it behaves like         14:04:52

        17      an architecture.  The Ares I program feeds into         14:04:53

        18      the Ares V program.  Developmental costs for            14:04:54

        19      engines are borne in the early part of the              14:04:56

        20      program and then used in both segments of the           14:04:56

        21      program.                                                14:04:56

        22                So when one starts contemplating              14:05:00


                                                              213



         1      replacing pieces of that architecture, all kinds        14:05:03

         2      of things begin to happen, as you see here.  You        14:05:08

         3      see industrial sustainment costs, workforce             14:05:10

         4      issues, perhaps pad issues that you hadn't              14:05:14

         5      contemplated.                                           14:05:17

         6                So when viewing the particular small          14:05:18

         7      slice of can the Delta IV Heavy take humans to          14:05:21

         8      low Earth orbit for less than the Ares I, the           14:05:25

         9      Aerospace Center answer is, depending on which          14:05:28

        10      option you pick, yes, quickly followed by are           14:05:31

        11      you still going to build an Ares V and do you           14:05:33

        12      still want to maintain that infrastructure, at          14:05:33

        13      which time frankly the total cost of the total          14:05:37

        14      mission for NASA depends heavily on what NASA           14:05:39

        15      needs to do to sustain that program should such         14:05:42

        16      a decision be made.                                     14:05:46

        17                Mr. Chairman, it's my pleasure to             14:05:48

        18      present this initial look into our work, and I'd        14:05:50

        19      be happy to entertain your questions.                   14:05:53

        20                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          14:05:56

        21      We've got, I think, just a couple of minutes if         14:05:58

        22      anybody has questions.                                  14:05:58


                                                              214



         1                MR. BEJMUK:  I have a question, Norm.         14=
:05:58

         2                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Fine.  We've           14:05:58

         3      got two here.  I saw both.                              14:05:58

         4                MR. BEJMUK:  You go first this time.          14:06:00

         5                MR. GREASON:  All right.  I've got            14:06:00

         6      two, but they're quick.  I just want to make            14:06:06

         7      sure I'm not misreading what's in here.                 14:06:09

         8                The no upper stage option for the             14:06:11

         9      existing Orion capsule, that's the same service         14:06:13

        10      module that was already previously planned -- is        14:06:18

        11      that correct -- and it just burns to do --              14:06:19

        12                MR. PULLIAM:  Yes.                            14:06:00

        13                MR. GREASON:  -- the rest of the              14:06:00

        14      Delta V?                                                14:06:21

        15                If it were true that we had the               14:06:26

        16      ability to do RNO propellant supply, then you           14:06:27

        17      could also do the next piece of the mission by          14:06:29

        18      putting the gas back in, right?                         14:06:32

        19                MR. PULLIAM:  I'm looking at my expert        14:06:34

        20      across the room.                                        14:06:36

        21                MR. JOHNSON:  We'd have to look at            14:06:37

        22      that.                                                   14:06:25


                                                              215



         1                MR. GREASON:  Okay.                           14:06:25

         2                MR. PULLIAM:  We didn't study it for          14:06:25

         3      this.                                                   14:06:38

         4                MR. GREASON:  Okay.  No problem.  And         14:06:38

         5      the second very quick one is -- you said that           14:06:38

         6      this 5.5- to 7-year human rating development            14:06:40

         7      time is based on the past historical experience,        14:06:43

         8      but the only past historical experience I can           14:06:47

         9      think of is when we put people on the original          14:06:49

        10      Atlas and the original Titan.                           14:06:50

        11                What did it take to human rate those          14:06:52


        12      vehicles?                                               14:06:55

        13                MR. PULLIAM:  Can you help me, Ray?           14:06:56

        14                MR. JOHNSON:  Well, we went through           14:06:58

        15      much the same process.  They had to look at             14:07:00

        16      things like redundant actuators on the ends, you        14:07:00

        17      know, they had to look at structural margins and        14:07:01

        18      things like that.                                       14:07:04

        19                MR. GREASON:  But it took 5.5 to              14:07:05

        20      7 years?                                                14:07:08

        21                MR. JOHNSON:  We'd have to go back and        14:07:11

        22      look at that.  I think that those were done much        14:07:14


                                                              216



         1      more quickly under the circumstances, but we            14:07:15

         2      based it on what they have looked at for the            14:07:18

         3      human rating of other systems.  But also it's           14:07:19

         4      just simply the development of recent space how         14:07:22

         5      long it's taken is part of what we looked at.           14:07:25

         6                MR. PULLIAM:  This is Mr. Ray Johnson,        14:07:25

         7      who manages our entire group for launch vehicles        14:07:25

         8      at the Aerospace Corporation.                           14:07:25

         9                So it is a conservative estimate.             14:07:30

        10      We'd be delighted if it were less than that, but        14:07:32

        11      as we looked at the things that we think go into        14:07:36

        12      it and how long we would take, we came up with          14:07:37

        13      that bound of 5.5 to 7.                                 14:07:39

        14                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yes, sir.                     14:07:43

        15                MR. BEJMUK:  The question:  If you            14:07:43

        16      replace Ares I with Delta IV Heavy, production          14:07:45

        17      of solid rocket segments goes from -- to support        14:07:50

        18      the shuttle is around 50 a year.  For Ares I            14:07:57

        19      that drops down to some smaller number and then         14:08:01

        20      later picks up when you bring on Ares V.                14:08:05

        21                In this scenario -- and I don't know          14:08:08


        22      if you guys had a chance to look at that -- if          14:08:09


                                                              217



         1      you, let's say, propose and get Delta IV to fly         14:08:12

         2      to ISS, you essentially want to cease production        14:08:17

         3      of the solid segments until you ultimately start        14:08:20

         4      needing it for Ares V.                                  14:08:26

         5                And the question is:  Is it possible          14:08:27

         6      that we are killing a country's capability to do        14:08:29

         7      those solid motors?                                     14:08:34

         8                MR. PULLIAM:  Well, you put your              14:08:35

         9      finger right on what we believe is one of the           14:08:37

        10      critical issues surrounding any alternative one         14:08:37

        11      might choose, and you've said it --                     14:08:40

        12                MR. BEJMUK:  Did you have it in your          14:08:40

        13      briefing?  I missed it, I guess, if you did.            14:08:42

        14                MR. PULLIAM:  We did do some work on          14:08:43

        15      that which will hopefully be releasable when the        14:08:46

        16      more detailed work comes out.                           14:08:47

        17                We do acknowledge exactly, as you've          14:08:49

        18      said, that now there are two primary                    14:08:51

        19      manufacturers of solid rocket motors and only           14:08:54

        20      one those is the manufacturer of large segmented        14:08:57

        21      solids.  The Ares I is intended to have a               14:08:57

        22      five-segment solid.  The Ares V is intended to          14:09:03


                                                              218



         1      have a 5-1/2-segment solid.  So that is all             14:09:07

         2      understood from an industrial capacity.                 14:09:12

         3                If you cease building the Ares I, then        14:09:13

         4      the big question becomes do you still need to           14:09:16

         5      have the ability to produce segmented solids in         14:09:18

         6      a few years, and if you're going to build an            14:09:19

         7      Ares V, the answer to that is yes.                      14:09:20

         8                So then the next question becomes how         14:09:22

         9      do you do that.  And NASA can give you the              14:09:25


        10      particulars, but that is a key factor in that           14:09:28

        11      number that they believe is required of them to         14:09:31

        12      sustain that kind of capability over the years.         14:09:34

        13                So, you know, one can take excursions         14:09:36

        14      on other ways of doing the large rocket, but,           14:09:39

        15      again, for purposes of our scope for this               14:09:42

        16      program, we did look at that.  We understand            14:09:45

        17      that if you -- from a capacity perspective, if          14:09:48

        18      you stopped building segmented solids for a             14:09:50

        19      while until you needed them, that the resultant         14:09:54

        20      capacity in that industry should be viable, but         14:09:57

        21      I'm not the person trying to run that industry.         14:10:01

        22                I mean, the other supplier of that            14:10:03


                                                              219



         1      industry operates at about the level that the           14:10:06

         2      first supplier would wind up at.  But what              14:10:09

         3      happens to the people and the tools and the             14:10:09

         4      artisans and the techniques and the recipes             14:10:09

         5      and -- and the strike and missile defense area          14:10:15

         6      certainly would not sustain both of those               14:10:17

         7      suppliers.                                              14:10:20

         8                So we believe that if one is serious          14:10:21

         9      about moving away from the Ares I that there's          14:10:23

        10      still a bit of work to do there so that we              14:10:26

        11      really understand the effect of large segmented         14:10:29

        12      solids on the industrial base and what that             14:10:32

        13      means to the nation.                                    14:10:33

        14                MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you.                       14:10:35

        15                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Last question.         14:10:35

        16                MR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  I was just                 14:10:37

        17      wondering if you had done any PRA for loss of           14:10:38

        18      crew/loss of mission using this configuration?          14:10:41

        19                MR. PULLIAM:  We did not consider that        14:10:41


        20      for this one.  It was more of a technical cost          14:10:42

        21      and schedule feasibility study.                         14:10:45

        22                MR. CHIAO:  Okay.  Thank you.                 14:10:37


                                                              220



         1                MR. CHYBA:  Mr. Chairman, just an             14:10:49

         2      information request.  Clearly this 5.5- to              14:10:49

         3      7-year human rating time scale is a very                14:10:52

         4      important time scale.  I'd like to ask if we            14:10:53

         5      could be given by Aerospace more detail --              14:10:56

         6                MR. PULLIAM:  Absolutely.                     14:10:56

         7                MR. CHYBA:  -- on the origin of that          14:10:59

         8      number, perhaps something in --                         14:11:01

         9                MR. PULLIAM:  Absolutely.

        10                MR. CHYBA:  -- writing explaining the

        11      origin in detail.

        12                MR. PULLIAM:  There's, as you might

        13      expect --

        14                MR. CHYBA:  Thanks.                           14:11:03

        15                MR. PULLIAM:  -- enormous technical           14:11:03

        16      underpinning to all of these, and while we're           14:11:05

        17      pleased to bring to you what is releasable              14:11:06

        18      today, we recognize that the committee might            14:11:10

        19      desire to get some of the details behind these.         14:11:10

        20      We'll be happy to do that.                              14:11:12

        21                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Gary, I had a similar         14:11:13

        22      request.  It relates to the industrial base             14:11:15


                                                              221



         1      backup data and the human resource backup data.         14:11:17

         2                MR. PULLIAM:  We'll be happy to.              14:11:21

         3                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          14:11:22

         4                MR. PULLIAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.        14:11:24

         5                MR. AUGUSTINE:  We appreciate it.             14:11:25

         6                Okay.  We will now talk about some            14:11:28

         7      more commercial launch capability options.  And         14:11:29

         8      the first one we'll talk about is the NASA COTS         14:11:32

         9      program.  I think Doug Cooke is going to make           14:11:36


        10      that presentation.                                      14:11:38

        11                And we've got four presentations in           14:11:41

        12      one hour and a half.  And so if I've done my            14:11:47

        13      arithmetic right, it says we've got like                14:11:50

        14      20 minutes including questions per each.  So            14:11:54

        15      we'd appreciate that.                                   14:11:57

        16                MR. COOKE:  Right.  I will try to keep        14:12:02

        17      this short because I should give the companies a        14:12:04

        18      chance to talk about what they're doing.                14:12:05

        19                We, in the Exploration Systems Mission        14:12:08

        20      Directorate, have the management of the                 14:12:11

        21      commercial crew and cargo effort at NASA, known         14:12:13

        22      as COTS.  And I guess we're looking for charts.         14:12:17


                                                              222



         1                But that is something that we've had          14:12:24

         2      in place and it's an effort that we're proud of.        14:12:26

         3      We can go ahead to the next chart.                      14:12:30

         4                You can point back -- and let's go            14:12:31

         5      ahead and go beyond that.  I'm going to talk            14:12:33

         6      about these subjects.  Let's go to the next one.        14:12:36

         7                You can point back in terms of                14:12:39

         8      national policy in space all of the way back to         14:12:41

         9      the original space act in its promotion of              14:12:44

        10      commercial use of space.                                14:12:48

        11                More recently in 2004 with the vision         14:12:49

        12      for space exploration, also known the National          14:12:52

        13      Space Exploration Policy, there was specific            14:12:55

        14      interest in promoting commercial participation          14:13:00

        15      in exploration.  There was also talk about              14:13:03

        16      providing for pursuing the provision of                 14:13:08

        17      transportation to low Earth orbit by commercial         14:13:13

        18      capabilities.                                           14:13:18

        19                The authorization acts of 2005 and            14:13:19


        20      2008 supported this, and so we've been on that          14:13:24

        21      path.  If we can go to the next chart.                  14:13:27

        22                We established the Commercial Crew and        14:13:30


                                                              223



         1      Cargo Program down at Johnson Space Center in           14:13:39

         2      2005 to lead this effort.  It's a small office          14:13:42

         3      down there.  And their objectives are to                14:13:45

         4      implement the space policy and to facilitate            14:13:48

         5      U.S. private industry demonstration of cargo and        14:13:52

         6      crew capabilities.                                      14:13:59

         7                A particular tenet of all of this is          14:14:01

         8      that this effort is the development and                 14:14:04

         9      demonstration of this kind of capability, and           14:14:09

        10      what NASA does in this approach is to invest in         14:14:11

        11      these developments.  It's not a funded contract         14:14:15

        12      per se.  These are Space Act Agreements that we         14:14:20

        13      have, and we are investing in their                     14:14:22

        14      capabilities, as they move through them.  And           14:14:25

        15      I'll talk a little bit more about how that's            14:14:27

        16      done.                                                   14:14:30

        17                And so we have a goal of achieving            14:14:30

        18      safe, reliable and cost effective access to low         14:14:32

        19      Earth orbit and create a market environment for         14:14:35

        20      this type of capability.  We can go to the next         14:14:36

        21      chart.                                                  14:14:39

        22                As a part of this, in the budget, we          14:14:39


                                                              224



         1      have had a $500 million bucket that we have             14:14:47

         2      applied to this capability, these investments.          14:14:51

         3                We have been through two competitions         14:14:56

         4      on this.  We're actually -- in terms of                 14:14:58

         5      commercial crew and cargo, we're in -- and in           14:15:01

         6      this case, it's cargo -- we have two phases.            14:15:07

         7      The first phase is a development and                    14:15:10


         8      demonstration phase where we are making those           14:15:14

         9      investments.  The second phase is actually a            14:15:16

        10      procurement of these services once the                  14:15:20

        11      capabilities are developed.  And I believe Mike         14:15:22

        12      Suffredini is going to talk about that second           14:15:25

        13      phase.                                                  14:15:28

        14                In Phase 1, in going back in history,         14:15:28

        15      in August of 2006 we selected two companies for         14:15:31

        16      funded Space Act Agreements.                            14:15:35

        17                One was SpaceX, and that was for an           14:15:38

        18      amount of 278 million over a period of years.           14:15:41

        19      We are still going through that.  The money is          14:15:45

        20      tied to milestones and development of different         14:15:48

        21      types of milestones, both funding and technical.        14:15:53

        22                We also at that time selected                 14:15:57


                                                              225



         1      Rocketplane Kistler as a recipient at -- I can't        14:16:00

         2      remember -- I believe it's 208 million -- for           14:16:07

         3      another funded Space Act Agreement.  We actually        14:16:13

         4      terminated that later because they could not            14:16:17

         5      make the milestones.  And then we had another           14:16:20

         6      solicitation in which we awarded a Space Act            14:16:24

         7      Agreement to Orbital Sciences in February of            14:16:28

         8      last year.                                              14:16:32

         9                So in Phase 1 we've had two different         14:16:34

        10      solicitations, and we now have two funded Space         14:16:39

        11      Act Agreements on board that are progressing.           14:16:42

        12                And I'll leave the Phase 2 procurement        14:16:46

        13      part of this to the final presentation because          14:16:47

        14      they'll talk about that in more detail.  If we          14:16:50

        15      go to the next chart.                                   14:16:50

        16                This is a diagram that talks about --         14:16:53

        17      it talks about the COTS effort and the types of         14:16:58


        18      capabilities that we look to.  And you hear             14:17:04

        19      about capability -- COTS-D and that sort of             14:17:06

        20      thing.                                                  14:17:09

        21                So what we have is we have COTS-A,            14:17:09

        22      which is external cargo delivery and disposal.          14:17:11


                                                              226



         1      We have COTS-B, which is internal cargo delivery        14:17:15

         2      and disposal.  We have COTS-C, which is internal        14:17:18

         3      cargo delivery and return -- return of cargo in         14:17:23

         4      that case.  And then COTS-D is commercial crew          14:17:27

         5      transport.  So when you hear these terms, that's        14:17:32

         6      what they represent.                                    14:17:35

         7                And when we had the solicitations, the        14:17:36

         8      companies bid against those different                   14:17:40

         9      capabilities, and they did not have to bid              14:17:43

        10      against all of them.  So we had different               14:17:45

        11      approaches to how this would be done.  If we can        14:17:48

        12      go to the next one.                                     14:17:49

        13                So we have, as I said, two funded             14:17:49

        14      Space Act Agreements.  The one we selected first        14:17:55

        15      that's still on board is SpaceX.  They bid at           14:17:58

        16      278 million for the cargo part of this.  And            14:18:04

        17      also in that proposal they proposed crew                14:18:08

        18      capability at 308 million.  It is with a                14:18:13

        19      Falcon 9 vehicle with a dragon crew and cargo           14:18:18

        20      development.                                            14:18:25

        21                We are funded actually for only the           14:18:25

        22      cargo part.  So that's the part we're currently         14:18:28


                                                              227



         1      pursuing.  If we go to the next one.                    14:18:31

         2                The next one is Orbital Sciences, and,        14:18:33

         3      once again, we selected this last year.  This           14:18:37

         4      was $170 million award, once again, tied to             14:18:41

         5      milestone payments.  And it has a pressurized           14=
:18:45

         6      module that's based on the Space Station MPLM,          14:18:49

         7      the logistics module, and it has unpressurized          14:18:57

         8      capability.  And they launch out of Wallops.            14:19:02

         9      The SpaceX rocket is at Pad 40C at the Cape.            14:19:07

        10                So both these have demonstrations that        14:19:14

        11      they get to.  And that is as far as COTS -- this        14:19:17

        12      part of the effort, COTS Phase I, takes it.  So         14:19:21

        13      we're, once again, in development and                   14:19:26

        14      demonstration, and we reach culmination of that         14:19:29

        15      as these capabilities are demonstrated.  So if          14:19:33

        16      we can go to the next one.                              14:19:36

        17                We do have two unfunded Space Act             14:19:38

        18      Agreements at this point, one with SpaceDev and         14:19:40

        19      one with PlanetSpace.  And we do interact with          14:19:44

        20      them, but these are unfunded.  So we don't --           14:19:50

        21      but they are Space Act Agreements, and we work          14:19:52

        22      with them.  And the next chart.                         14:19:55


                                                              228



         1                So the next two charts you can't read         14:19:57

         2      but -- I can't either in this case but -- and I         14:20:00

         3      don't intend to.  But this is for the committee.        14:20:05

         4      And for reference, these are the -- what I've           14:20:08

         5      got listed on the next two pages are the                14:20:12

         6      milestones and the plan dates for those as of           14:20:16

         7      the different revs of the Space Act Agreements,         14:20:19

         8      and it actually shows the amounts that are              14:20:23

         9      awarded with each milestone.  These were                14:20:25

        10      negotiated in the Space Act Agreement, and so           14:20:28

        11      we're stepping through those at this point.             14:20:30

        12                And for SpaceX we have awarded -- I           14:20:34

        13      believe it's about 234 million out of 278- at           14:20:38

        14      this point, and with Orbital Sciences we're at          14:20:44

        15      100- out of 170-.  So these represent milestones        14:20:48


        16      and progress on these efforts.  So this is the          14:20:53

        17      way in which we invest in these capabilities.           14:20:57

        18                So with that, I want to move on to            14:21:01

        19      just another short topic on this subject.  Go to        14:21:03

        20      the next slide.                                         14:21:07

        21                In the American Recovery and                  14:21:07

        22      Reinvestment Act, Exploration received                  14:21:12


                                                              229



         1      $400 million.  That's where it's allocated to           14:21:14

         2      Exploration.                                            14:21:18

         3                150- of this is planned for the               14:21:19

         4      commercial crew and cargo effort, and it's shown        14:21:21

         5      delineated here.                                        14:21:25

         6                80 million is actually for                    14:21:26

         7      solicitation in order to get proposals on               14:21:29

         8      developing capabilities that will make progress         14:21:36

         9      toward the crew capability.                             14:21:41

        10                There's $42 million to accelerate the         14:21:43

        11      development of a docking system that would help         14:21:46

        12      in terms of the crew capability and support of          14:21:48

        13      the Space Station.                                      14:21:54

        14                There's 20 million to advance some of         14:21:55

        15      the work in getting to confidence in the                14:21:57

        16      capability for -- as a part of the cargo                14:22:02

        17      development.                                            14:22:06

        18                And then there's an $8 million piece          14:22:06

        19      of this that's allocated to working on                  14:22:08

        20      collecting and putting in one place the human           14:22:14

        21      rating -- a set of human-rating requirements.           14:22:17

        22                Right now we have a human-rating              14:22:21


                                                              230



         1      requirements document, but it has fingers into a        14:22:22

         2      lot of different requirements and standards             14:22:27


         3      across the agency.  This would be an effort to          14:22:28

         4      try to make that a more collected set of                14:22:32

         5      information that would help any needs in                14:22:35

         6      developing this kind of capability.                     14:22:41

         7                And with that, I'll conclude, and             14:22:43

         8      we're ready to move on.                                 14:22:45

         9                (Inaudible.)                                  14:22:46

        10                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Let's see.  SpaceX is         14:22:46

        11      next.  Elon Musk.                                       14:22:58

        12                MR. MUSK:  All right.  I think we're          14:23:16

        13      just waiting for the slides to pop up.  There we        14:23:18

        14      go.                                                     14:23:18

        15                That's just a photo of Falcon 9 on the        14:23:21

        16      launch pad at Cape Canaveral.  That's a real            14:23:45

        17      photo.  It's not touched up or anything.                14:23:46

        18                And that's the vehicle that will be           14:23:49

        19      carrying cargo to the Space Station.  We'll do          14:23:50

        20      our first test flight later this year carrying          14:23:53

        21      our Dragon spacecraft, and then next year we'll         14:23:58

        22      be doing our first flight that actually goes to         14:23:58


                                                              231



         1      the Space Station carrying cargo and bringing it        14:24:01

         2      back.                                                   14:24:03

         3                I mean, before I -- one thing I think         14:24:04

         4      it's very important for the public to realize is        14:24:07

         5      that we're currently on a path to sole source           14:24:11

         6      human space flight to the Russians.  I don't            14:24:14

         7      think this is really -- people have quite               14:24:19

         8      realized this in the general public, but that's         14:24:20

         9      what's going to happen right after the space            14:24:24

        10      shuttle retires -- we're sole sourced to the            14:24:27

        11      Russians and will be so until there is an               14:24:31

        12      alternative.                                            14:24:33

        13                We believe we can eliminate that gap          14:24:35


        14      or substantially reduce it at least, and I think        14:24:36

        15      it would be money very well spent to have an            14:24:40

        16      American entrant into that race rather than the         14:24:42

        17      current Space Station situation.  Next slide.           14:24:45

        18                SpaceX is about seven years old, but          14:24:47

        19      the primary goal of SpaceX is actually                  14:24:54

        20      reliability and it's not reducing costs,                14:24:56

        21      although we do reduce costs quite a bit as well.        14:24:59

        22      We have about 800 employees who are growing at          14:25:05


                                                              232



         1      about 50 percent a year.  We're in California,          14:25:07

         2      Texas and Florida primarily.                            14:25:08

         3                And really the whole purpose of SpaceX        14:25:11

         4      from the very beginning has been human space            14:25:15

         5      flight.  That's the very reason I founded the           14:25:18

         6      company and created it.  So next slide.                 14:25:20

         7                We've been able to get a lot of               14:25:22

         8      customers on board at SpaceX.  So in addition to        14:25:24

         9      NASA and the Defense Department, we've got a            14:25:26

        10      Sweden, Malaysia, Canada, a number of commercial        14:25:28

        11      providers, all whom have done technical and             14:25:33

        12      financial due diligence on SpaceX and concluded         14:25:36

        13      that SpaceX is a wise bet and put down deposits         14:25:37

        14      for launches.  Next slide.                              14:25:44

        15                We reached orbit last year with               14:25:44

        16      Falcon 1.  Falcon 1 is a complete ground-up             14:25:44

        17      development.  So we developed the main engine,          14:25:51

        18      the upper stage engine, the structures, the             14:25:54

        19      avionics, the launch infrastructure and launched        14:25:56

        20      the rocket with cryogenic propellant from a             14:25:56

        21      remote tropical island, which is not easy.              14:26:02

        22                So it's also important to note that           14:26:05


                                                              233




         1      there are huge lessons learned in Falcon 1 going        14:26:07

         2      to Falcon 9.  In fact, much of the same hardware        14:26:13

         3      that's in Falcon 1 goes into Falcon 9.                  14:26:16

         4                And as far as the engine is                   14:26:19

         5      concerned -- and there were some questions              14:26:21

         6      raised earlier about the engines -- there have          14:26:22

         7      only been three engines developed in the                14:26:26

         8      United States that have seen orbital flight in          14:26:29

         9      the last -- since, I think, the space shuttle           14:26:29

        10      main engine about -- almost 30 years ago is when        14:26:33

        11      it was developed.  One of them was the RS-68,           14:26:35

        12      which is used in the Delta IV.  The other two           14:26:38

        13      are the Merlin and Kestrel engines developed by         14:26:41

        14      SpaceX, which are hydrocarbon engines.  Next            14:26:45

        15      slide.                                                  14:26:48

        16                Here you can see some pictures of             14:26:49

        17      Falcon 1 getting prepared for its next flight.          14:26:50

        18      It will be carrying a satellite for Malaysia.           14:26:53

        19      Next slide.                                             14:26:53

        20                I'm going to go very quickly through          14:26:56

        21      these slides since I only have 20 minutes.              14:26:57

        22                We've made substantial reductions in          14:26:59


                                                              234



         1      costs across the board in our engines structures        14:27:02

         2      avionics and launch operation.                          14:27:05

         3                Again, I'm going to be reemphasizing          14:27:09

         4      this many times.  Falcon 9 was designed from the        14:27:13

         5      beginning to be a human-carrying vessel.                14:27:17

         6                It also has something which people            14:27:20

         7      have taken for granted in airliners, which is           14:27:22

         8      engine-out capability.  So I think a lot of             14:27:26

         9      people would be uncomfortable getting on an             14:27:27

        10      airliner where -- with one engine, and yet              14:27:29

        11      that's par for the course in rockets.  In fact,         14:27:33


        12      in a lot of rockets it's even worse than that.          14:27:37

        13      Because you may have three engines and if any           14:27:40

        14      one of those fails, the mission fails.                  14:27:43

        15                With Falcon 9 we've designed it in a          14:27:47

        16      way similar to the Saturn I and Saturn V, which         14:27:48

        17      had engine-out capability.  If you lose an              14:27:52

        18      engine, it doesn't matter.  You can still               14:27:53

        19      complete the mission.  Next slide.                      14:27:56

        20                There's a lot of videos on our                14:27:58

        21      website.  If people are curious, just go to             14:28:04

        22      spacex.com, and you can see engine test videos.         14:28:05

         1                This year SpaceX will manufacture more        14:28:07

         2      rocket engines than the rest of U.S. production         14:28:11

         3      combined, in fact, more than any country except         14:28:14

         4      Russia.  Next year we expect to exceed Russia.          14:28:18

         5      Next slide.                                             14:28:18

         6                That's the base of Falcon 9.  It bears        14:28:23

         7      some resemblance to the base of the Saturn I,           14:28:26

         8      which had eight engines rather than our nine.           14:28:28

         9      Some pretty epic engine firing videos.  Some            14:28:33

        10      very funny videos on YouTube of the locals              14:28:37

        11      observing the engine firings.  Next slide.              14:28:44

        12                Some pictures our factory in                  14:28:47

        15                Here's Falcon 9 going through final           14:28:53

        16      qualifications.  We expect to be ready to launch        14:28:57

        17      Falcon 9 later this year, and hopefully we'll           14:29:00

        18      have the first and second flight stages on the          14:29:06

        19      pad by the end of summer.  So you can see               14:29:09

        20      pictures of the factory and various stages of           14:29:12

        21      the qualification.  Next slide.                         14:29:14


        22                I'm going to go very quickly.  This is        14:29:15

         1      Falcon 9 on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral.           14:29:21

         2      Next slide.                                             14:29:21

         3                More Cape Canaveral stuff.  Next              14:29:26

         4      slide.                                                  14:29:31

         5                There's Dragon.  That's the full --           14:29:31

         6      (inaudible) -- structural test unit of our              14:29:38

         7      Dragon spacecraft.  Our Dragon spacecraft is            14:29:38

         8      designed explicitly to meet the NASA                    14:29:40

         9      human-rating standards, and we're 90 percent            14:29:46

        10      complete on that qualification.  It's worth             14:29:48

        11      noting that Dragon has five windows -- four             14:29:52

        12      windows, I should say, and you don't need               14:29:53

        13      windows for cargo, you know, to state the               14:29:55

        14      obvious.  Next slide.                                   14:29:58

        15                Dragon going through structural               14:29:59

        16      qualification testing.  The two driving load            14:30:04

        17      cases for Dragon are the -- worse-case abort.           14:30:07

        18      So if the system aborts, the worse case, and you        14:30:12

        19      have these reentry loads, you can have it coming        14:30:14

        20      in at 15 or 16 G's.  So it's designed to meet           14:30:16

        21      those loads.  It's also designed to meet the            14:30:20

        22      loads associated with a launch escape tower.            14:30:23

         1      Next slide.                                             14:30:23

         2                That's more SpaceX hardware.  I               14:30:23

         3      forgot -- I almost forgot to mention -- our             14:30:29

         4      Draco engine, that's our in-space engine.  So           14:30:33

         5      it's basically -- it's actually another -- a            14:30:34

         6      third engine which is used for in-space                 14:30:34

         7      maneuvering for -- primarily for docking and            14:30:37

         8      orbital translation.  Next slide.                       14:30:42

         9                More hardware.  This is our heat              14=
:30:44

        10      shield on the bottom left.  We developed the            14:30:45

        11      PICA-X, which is an improved form of PICA, in           14:30:49

        12      conjunction with NASA Ames.  Next slide.                14:30:51

        13                More hardware.  This is the                   14:30:55

        14      communications unit for communicating between           14:30:57

        15      Dragon and the Space Station, and that will be          14:31:00

        16      delivered at the end of the month.  It's quite a        14:31:04

        17      tricky thing to do.  Also the crew command              14:31:06

        18      panel.  Next slide.                                     14:31:10

        19                DragonEye, this is a LIDAR system             14:31:12

        20      that's used to image the Space Station.  As             14:31:12

        21      Dragon approaches the Space Station, it's got to        14:31:12

        22      figure out relative orientation and the approach        14:31:19


                                                              238



         1      vectors and then plot a course to berth with the        14:31:21

         2      Space Station.  That's going to get flown on the        14:31:25

         3      STS-127, which is currently on the pad.  So it          14:31:28

         4      will be tested before we even go up for this            14:31:32

         5      Dragon mission.  Next slide.                            14:31:36

         6                We've completed the Space Station             14:31:37

         7      Safety Review Panel Phase 1 and most of 2.  We          14:31:41

         8      expect to finish Phase 3 in early next year.            14:31:42

         9      It's important to appreciate that Dragon is --          14:31:45

        10      even for cargo, Dragon has to be human rated for        14:31:48

        11      the approach to Space Station, for being at             14:31:52

        12      Space Station and for leaving Space Station,            14:31:55

        13      because there are people in Space Station.  Next        14:31:57

        14      slide.                                                  14:32:01

        15                We've done 14 of the 22 milestones on         14:32:01

        16      schedule, all financing rounds and all design           14:32:06

        17      reviews through critical design review.  There          14:32:08

        18      have been several major hardware milestones also        14:32:12

        19      in there.                                               14:32:12


        20                There's going to be some slips in the         14:32:15

        21      remaining milestones, but we're talking about           14:32:16

        22      slips that are measured in months, not years,           14:32:19


                                                              239



         1      which is relatively minor in the space industry.        14:32:21

         2                And so we're expecting to complete all        14:32:26

         3      of our demonstrations next year -- by summer            14:32:29

         4      next year.  And next slide.                             14:32:32

         5                As I mentioned, crew capability is the        14:32:36

         6      very reason SpaceX was founded.  So we will do          14:32:39

         7      whatever we need to do to make this happen.             14:32:42

         8      Next slide.                                             14:32:46

         9                So one of the advantages of using the         14:32:46

        10      Dragon for crew is that it will already have            14:33:00

        11      been flown many times with cargo.  So you have          14:33:02

        12      essentially the same vehicle, the same                  14:33:05

        13      spacecraft and the same rocket that will have           14:33:07

        14      flown many times before you even put people on          14:33:10

        15      board.  This is a huge -- a risk-retirement             14:33:14

        16      approach.  So, you know, it should be pretty            14:33:18

        17      safe by the time you'd want to put people in it.        14:33:21

        18      Next slide.                                             14:33:24

        19                Regarding the effects of safety,              14:33:24

        20      again, we're designed to the 1.4 factor of              14:33:31

        21      safety throughout the vehicle unequivocally.            14:33:35

        22      The EELVs would require some work at least in           14:33:39


                                                              240



         1      some places to get to 1.4.  The Falcon 9 does           14:33:42

         2      not.  It was designed for that from the                 14:33:46

         3      beginning.  Next slide.                                 14:33:50

         4                So in terms of what is necessary to go        14:33:50

         5      from the cargo Dragon to the crew Dragon,               14:33:56

         6      there's only one major development item, and            14:34:00


         7      that is the launch escape system.  And that's           14:34:03

         8      the driving -- that drives the schedule for             14:34:07

         9      completion of crew capability, and that is an           14:34:08

        10      approximately 24-month development cycle.               14:34:11

        11                So we've already done the preliminary         14:34:15

        12      design on that.  We need to complete the design,        14:34:17

        13      qualify it and test it.  That two years --              14:34:20

        14      basically from the moment NASA says go, it's            14:34:22

        15      about two years minimum to get that capability          14:34:25

        16      working.                                                14:34:28

        17                If you add some margin in there -- if         14:34:29

        18      you add another six to nine months of margin,           14:34:31

        19      that says, I think, comfortably under three             14:34:34

        20      years to get -- from today to get human                 14:34:37

        21      capability.  So that really eliminates the gap,         14:34:39

        22      from our standpoint.                                    14:34:44


                                                              241



         1                I mean -- I do agree, by the way, with        14:34:45

         2      having both Soyuz flights and COTS crew flights         14:34:48

         3      at the same time, you know, as planned for the          14:34:54

         4      same year, because you want to make sure that           14:34:56

         5      you -- that there's no gap there.                       14:34:58

         6                So I do agree with the approach that          14:35:00

         7      the space operations director of NASA has to            14:35:05

         8      purchase or use flights.  I would do the same in        14:35:08

         9      their position.  I just think it makes sense to         14:35:14

        10      turn on commercial crew capability and have it          14:35:16

        11      planned for that same period of time.                   14:35:20

        12                We can also do what's called a                14:35:22

        13      life-boat Dragon which is just an emergency             14:35:26

        14      escape vehicle.  We can do that a lot faster            14:35:29

        15      than we could do the ascent phase because no            14:35:31

        16      launch escape system is needed.  So we could do         14:35:34

        17      the life-boat Dragon in one and a half years,           14:35:37


        18      which would improve the capability of the Space         14:35:41

        19      Station because our Dragon -- our crew capsule          14:35:45

        20      is capable of carrying seven people rather than         14:35:47

        21      three people for the Soyuz escape vehicle.  Next        14:35:50

        22      slide.                                                  14:35:55


                                                              242



         1                So there's a lot of value that's been         14:35:55

         2      delivered for -- under the COTS program.  I             14:35:58

         3      mean, if you compare this to almost any other           14:36:02

         4      space development program, you say what did the         14:36:03

         5      government get for $278 million -- actually they        14:36:05

         6      haven't even paid 278 million -- 230 million.           14:36:08

         7                This is pretty -- this would be pretty        14:36:13

         8      darn high on the list of highest value for the          14:36:15

         9      money.  So, yeah.  All right.  Next slide.              14:36:18

        10                So, yeah.  Next slide.  I think I've          14:36:18

        11      probably got like two minutes left.                     14:36:18

        12                I think we've seen this slide.  Next          14:36:18

        13      slide.                                                  14:36:21

        14                So COTS is really an enabling function        14:36:21

        15      for NASA.  By having COTS, again, commercial            14:36:39

        16      crew servicing of low Earth orbit activity at an        14:36:43

        17      affordable cost, that is really -- that really          14:36:46

        18      enables NASA to go beyond low Earth orbit, to go        14:36:48

        19      to the Moon, to go to Mars and maybe go to an           14:36:51

        20      astroid.                                                14:36:55

        21                On the other hand, if NASA's budget           14:36:55

        22      is -- has to be dedicated to low Earth orbit            14:36:59


                                                              243



         1      servicing, then that's all NASA can do.  And the        14:37:01

         2      reality is that NASA is not going to get a giant        14:37:05

         3      budget increase.                                        14:37:10

         4                So it seems like the only way                 14:37:11


         5      forward -- the only way we're going to do               14:37:12

         6      exciting things in human space flight is if             14:37:13

         7      commercial companies handle the low Earth orbit         14:37:18

         8      stuff and NASA focuses on the stuff beyond low          14:37:19

         9      Earth orbit.  Next slide.                               14:37:24

        10                That's it.  Any questions?                    14:37:26

        11                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Great.  Elon, thank           14:37:28

        12      you.                                                    14:37:28

        13                Are there questions?                          14:37:29

        14                Please, Chris...                              14:37:34

        15                MR. CHYBA:  Thank you.  On one of your        14:37:34

        16      early slides on the Falcon 9, you included the          14:37:36

        17      statement that it has a greater than five time          14:37:39

        18      cost reduction compared to domestic competitors.        14:37:42

        19                I simply don't understand what that's         14:37:46

        20      trying to tell me.  Can you elaborate on that?          14:37:46

        21                MR. MUSK:  Sure.  That's just if you          14:37:50

        22      take the cost of -- the average cost of an              14:37:52


                                                              244



         1      ELV -- yeah -- and you compare that to our              14:37:55

         2      vehicle it's somewhere around four or five X            14:38:01

         3      difference.  But Falcon 9 is about a $40 million        14:38:06

         4      cost per flight -- per mission commercially.  My        14:38:12

         5      understanding is that if you had an equivalent          14:38:13

         6      ELV you'd be paying closer to 200 million or            14:38:15

         7      just below 200 million.                                 14:38:19

         8                MR. CHYBA:  Okay.  Thank you.                 14:37:34

         9                MR. MUSK:  But that's particularly            14:38:22

        10      when you factor in the fact that there's                14:38:22

        11      Air Force infrastructure payments that have to          14:38:25

        12      be divided by those flights, which we do not            14:38:29

        13      receive.                                                14:38:32

        14                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Leroy...                      14:38:33

        15                MR. CHIAO:  Thank you for your                14:38:35


        16      presentation.  Congratulations on your success          14:38:35

        17      to date.  I had a question on Falcon 9 and              14:38:35

        18      Dragon.                                                 14:38:38

        19                Assuming COTS-D goes forward, do you          14:38:39

        20      have a test program identified for Falcon 9             14:38:44

        21      before you'd have confidence to put a crew on           14:38:46

        22      board?                                                  14:38:46


                                                              245



         1                MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  Absolutely.                 14:38:35

         2                MR. CHIAO:  And how many flights do           14:38:35

         3      you envision having to -- for that test program?        14:38:52

         4                MR. MUSK:  Well, I think we'd want to         14:38:57

         5      have at least a dozen flights of Falcon 9 before        14:38:58

         6      we put crew on board.  But that's not going to          14:39:01

         7      be a problem because, I mean, we have right now         14:39:03

         8      21 flights on manifest already.                         14:39:06

         9                MR. CHIAO:  Okay.  And I assume also          14:39:09

        10      you'd have a test program for your crew escape          14:39:10

        11      system?                                                 14:39:15

        12                MR. MUSK:  Yes.                               14:39:15

        13                MR. CHIAO:  And would that be part of         14:38:35

        14      that test program?  Would it actually -- would          14:39:15

        15      you test that system off of Falcon 9?                   14:39:15

        16                MR. MUSK:  Yeah.  There are two major         14:39:15

        17      tests.  There's the pad abort test, which we            14:39:15

        18      don't -- we would not need the rocket for.  That        14:39:22

        19      could be done at White Sands or something like          14:39:25

        20      that.  And then there's a high altitude abort,          14:39:26

        21      which is really the same cost as a mission, if          14:39:31

        22      not slight greater.  So we'd want to do both of         14:39:32


                                                              246



         1      those tests.                                            14:39:34

         2                MR. CHIAO:  And then once you get a           14:39:35


         3      manned capsule, how many flights do you                 14:39:37

         4      envision -- manned flights into orbit before you        14:39:40

         5      declare operational capability?                         14:39:46

         6                MR. MUSK:  Well, for that we would            14:39:48

         7      consult with NASA.  I think that would be as            14:39:51

         8      much NASA's call, if not more, than ours.  But          14:39:52

         9      I'd figure at least two or three.                       14:39:57

        10                Because there's very little difference        14:39:58

        11      between our crew versus cargo version, it's kind        14:40:01

        12      of a different situation than many developments         14:40:05

        13      before which have been dedicated to crew or             14:40:07

        14      dedicated to cargo.                                     14:40:10

        15                MR. CHIAO:  Okay.  Thanks.                    14:38:35

        16                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          14:40:12

        17                MR. MUSK:  All right.  Thank you.             14:40:12

        18                MR. AUGUSTINE:  We appreciate it a            14:40:14

        19      lot.                                                    14:40:14

        20                We'll turn to Orbital next.                   14:40:15

        21                MR. CULBERTSON:  Good afternoon               14:40:33

        22      Mr. Chairman and Members of the Commission.             14:40:34

         1      Thank you very much for the opportunity to              14:40:36

         2      present to you today and to the members of the          14:40:37

         3      audience that are here.                                 14:40:39

         4                Just a couple of words of introduction        14:40:41

         5      about Orbital before I give you the status of           14:40:44

         6      our COTS system and -- our COTS effort and our          14:40:46

         7      Cargo Resupply Service program.                         14:40:50

         8                Orbital has been in existence for             14:40:52

         9      approximately 27 years.  We've deployed over            14:40:54

        10      500 systems into space, satellites and various          14:40:57

        11      other orbiting vehicles.  We, in the last five          14:41:02

        12      years, have over 60 successful launches, and the        14:41:07

        13      company is continuing to move in many different         14:41:11


        14      directions to support space flight, both                14:41:14

        15      commercially and for the U.S. government.  And          14:41:17

        16      we think that this is a fantastic opportunity           14:41:20

        17      for the commercial sector to demonstrate what           14:41:24

        18      they can do to support this country in                  14:41:27

        19      maintaining human space flight.  Next slide,            14:41:28

        20      please.                                                 14:41:30

        21                The COTS architecture is basically            14:41:30

        22      five elements.  The Cygnus visiting vehicle             14:41:34


                                                              248



         1      includes the service module, and, of course, on         14:41:39

         2      the front of that is the cargo vehicle.                 14:41:41

         3      Currently we are contracted for eight missions          14:41:44

         4      on the CRS contract.  So we have changed our            14:41:47

         5      plan on the COTS mission from an unpressurized          14:41:51

         6      cargo module to a pressurized cargo module to           14:41:56

         7      demonstrate that capability end to end,                 14:41:58

         8      including opening the hatch and transferring.           14:41:58

         9                The Taurus II is our launch vehicle,          14:42:00

        10      and I'll go into more detail on that in a few           14:42:03

        11      minutes.                                                14:42:06

        12                And then, of course, we have the cargo        14:42:06

        13      operations which will allow us to work with NASA        14:42:10

        14      on the necessary cargo to sustain the station,          14:42:13

        15      mission operations to support the flight and            14:42:14

        16      then the integrated launch site operations at           14:42:16

        17      Wallops Flight Facility.  Next slide.                   14:42:20

        18                A brief overview of the mission itself        14:42:21

        19      from launch.  I know this is a very busy slide          14:42:24

        20      but for your read ahead tonight, I guess, on the        14:42:27

        21      plane.                                                  14:42:31

        22                It shows you the sequence from launch         14:42:31


                                                              249




         1      to rendezvous with the station, berthing by the         14:42:34

         2      station arm and then unberthing and de-orbiting         14:42:39

         3      to take the unwanted material from the station.         14:42:44

         4      Next slide.                                             14:42:47

         5                Taurus II.  Taurus II was originally          14:42:47

         6      planned by the company to fill the medium launch        14:42:51

         7      vehicle need in the nation with the impending           14:42:54

         8      end of the Delta II program and the gap that we         14:42:59

         9      perceived between some of our larger vehicles           14:43:02

        10      such as the Taurus and Minotaur IV and V and the        14:43:05

        11      heavy-lift vehicles.  The company decided to            14:43:11

        12      embark on new development program that was named        14:43:14

        13      Taurus II.                                              14:43:17

        14                As NASA's solidified to the COTS and          14:43:17

        15      then Cargo Resupply Service, Taurus II became           14:43:21

        16      the vehicle that we decided to use for that             14:43:25

        17      effort and is focused on that now.                      14:43:28

        18                The Cargo Resupply is -- its first            14:43:30

        19      nine customers and, of course, we are marketing         14:43:35

        20      to other areas to use Taurus II for supplying           14:43:36

        21      the needs of the nation as well as commercial           14:43:39

        22      customers.  It will have a great deal of                14:43:42

         1      capability and flexibility.  It's currently --          14:43:45

         2      original missions are planned out of Wallops,           14:43:49

         3      but we can launch out of other places, as you'll        14:43:52

         4      see in just a minute.                                   14:43:56

         5                Dual AJ26 engines, based on the NK-33         14:43:57

         6      engines from Russia, with a second stage                14:44:02

         7      provided by a Castor-30, which is a Heritage 120        14:44:05

         8      engine.                                                 14:44:08

         9                We are also working towards an                14:44:09

        10      enhanced second stage to fill the higher cargo          14:44:14

        11      needs in the out-years and talking to providers         14=
:44:17

        12      of that second stage at this point.  At the             14:44:20

        13      moment we are looking towards a liquid fuel             14:44:22

        14      second stage.                                           14:44:26

        15                It incorporates flight-proven                 14:44:29

        16      components from leading global suppliers and            14:44:33

        17      uses subsystems that we've already deployed on          14:44:37

        18      other orbital launch vehicles.                          14:44:39

        19                As you'll see on the next slide, we           14:44:40

        20      have a legacy all of the way back to Pegasus of         14:44:40

        21      using those systems, enhancing them and                 14:44:44

        22      increasing their capabilities.  And if you trace        14:44:46


                                                              251



         1      through the various legacies, you can see that          14:44:48

         2      it leads to Taurus II using the leverage of our         14:44:51

         3      heritage and the many years of launch success.          14:44:55

         6      bit busy, but it's just to show the comparison          14:45:02

         7      of the Taurus II projected performance to both          14:45:05

         8      low Earth orbit and higher -- next slide -- as          14:45:08

         9      well as a comparison to other known launch              14:45:11

        10      vehicles in terms of environments and                   14:45:14

        11      performance.  Next slide.                               14:45:15

        12                Payload Accommodations.  It's a               14:45:16

        13      3.9 meter fairing.  So it will accommodate most         14:45:22

        14      science payloads and, of course, will                   14:45:25

        15      accommodate the pressurized cargo module for the        14:45:27

        16      COTS mission as well as the CRS program.                14:45:33

        17                It's designed to maximize payload             14:45:36

        18      integration to make it efficient and effective.         14:45:39

        19      It will be integrated in a -- finally in the            14:45:42

        20      flow in a horizontal fashion, which will give us        14:45:45

        21      access to the payload until 24 hours before             14:45:49


        22      launch, and, of course, we'll maintain all of           14:45:51

         8      development the launch capabilities for a liquid        14:46:08

         9      rocket out of Wallops.  That has not been done          14:46:12

        10      before, and so we are working through the               14:46:14

        11      development aspects of that with a lot of               14:46:16

        12      cooperation from our partners in that.  Wallops         14:46:21

        13      will allow us to reach the Space Station orbit          14:46:21

        14      without any problem either from performance or          14:46:25

        15      trajectory.                                             14:46:28

        16                If we have payloads that we're going          14:46:29

        17      to fly in the future that require polar- or             14:46:32

        18      sun-synchronous, we have our options as well as         14:46:34

        19      the potential to launch out of Cape Canaveral           14:46:37

        20      should that need arise in the future.                   14:46:40

        21                Kodiak is very interested in talking          14:46:44

        22      to us about launching from there as they develop        14:46:47


                                                              253



         1      a new launch pad there.                                 14:46:49

         2                And then, of course, Vandenberg is an         14:46:49

         3      option for high inclination.  Next slide.               14:46:52

         4                The work in progress at Wallops Island        14:46:55

         5      is depicted on this slide.  You can see a number        14:46:57

         6      of facilities that will be either modified or           14:47:00

         7      updated or built to support this activity.              14:47:03

         8                In the upper left, the cargo                  14:47:07


         9      processing building exists on the main base now,        14:47:09

        10      and that will be used for the early missions for        14:47:12

        11      processing the payloads.  And then we're looking        14:47:12

        12      at developing additional facilities on the              14:47:15

        13      island to process as well as to fuel payloads.          14:47:18

        14                The horizontal integration facility is        14:47:22

        15      a new facility that will be built in the next           14:47:24

        16      year to process two vehicles simultaneously, and        14:47:27

        17      then the transporter/erector will carry the             14:47:30

        18      vehicle from the horizontal integration facility        14:47:35

        19      to the pad.                                             14:47:35

        20                The pad is the previous 0-A pad that          14:47:36

        21      was -- supported solid rockets and now is being         14:47:42

        22      modified to support liquid fueled rockets, and          14:47:48


                                                              254



         1      we're installing a liquid fueling facility, of          14:47:49

         2      course, to support that capability.  There are          14:47:50

         3      some modifications required to the pad, of              14:47:51

         4      course, to support the higher thrust as well as         14:47:53

         5      the transporter/erector that will carry the             14:47:54

         6      vehicle to the pad itself.                              14:47:58

         7                On the next slide, you see a depiction        14:48:00

         8      of how that will look in the future.  In the            14:48:03

         9      center of the photograph up there is an artist          14:48:07

        10      rendering of the Taurus II on the pad.  And the         14:48:10

        11      flame bucket extends out towards the seawall and        14:48:14

        12      so the ramp comes up from inland towards the            14:48:16

        13      line of sight and then the transporter/erector          14:48:18

        14      will place the rocket on the pad                        14:48:22

        15      approximately -- less than 24 hours before              14:48:25

        16      launch.                                                 14:48:28

        17                In addition to the work at Wallops, we        14:48:29

        18      are working with Stennis Space Center on                14:48:31

        19      constructing an engine test stand that will             14:48:34


        20      support our program, the testing of our engines         14:48:36

        21      prior to launch.  Next slide, please.                   14:48:38

        22                That's a big hole in the ground, and          14:48:41


                                                              255



         1      that's where they are right now in addition to          14:48:43

         2      some support structure.  But getting that hole          14:48:47

         3      started and building the flame trench to support        14:48:50

         4      the engine testing was a big step in cooperation        14:48:53

         5      with NASA under a Space Act Agreement with              14:48:57

         6      Orbital.  That will be a part of our flow of the        14:49:01

         7      engines coming from Aerojet in Sacramento.  Next        14:49:04

         8      slide.                                                  14:49:08

         9                These are the AJ26 engines.  In the           14:49:09

        10      lower right you can see there the number of             14:49:12

        11      engines that are in storage.  That's about half         14:49:14

        12      of them.  And then the engines themselves will          14:49:15

        13      be processed, modified and then shipped to              14:49:19

        14      Stennis for testing and then on to Wallops for          14:49:21

        15      integration testing there and for launch.  Next         14:49:25

        16      slide.                                                  14:49:28

        17                The upper stage on the early missions         14:49:28

        18      is a Castor-30.  The static fire of that is             14:49:30

        19      scheduled for this month, though I've heard it          14:49:34

        20      may delay until July.  ATK is developing this as        14:49:38

        21      an offshoot from the Castro-120 and will provide        14:49:42

        22      us with a lot of capability in the early                14:49:46


                                                              256



         1      missions and possibly some growth directly out          14:49:48

         2      of that engine.  Next slide.                            14:49:53

         3                The payload fairing tool gives you an         14:49:55

         4      idea of the size of the payload fairing and the         14:49:59

         5      dimensions -- or, rather, the configuration of          14:50:01

         6      it.  Next slide.                                        14:50:03


         7                The Cygnus visiting vehicle, it's a           14:50:05

         8      service module, on the right-hand side with the         14:50:11

         9      solar arrays, and then on the -- the gray on the        14:50:14

        10      left side is the pressurized cargo module.              14:50:16

        11                As I mentioned, we modified our plans         14:50:20

        12      on the COTS mission to move to the pressurized          14:50:20

        13      cargo module in order to demonstrate that               14:50:22

        14      capability once we were awarded the CRS contract        14:50:25

        15      and all of our missions were scheduled to be            14:50:29

        16      pressurized cargo.  Next slide.                         14:50:33

        17                The PCM itself will accommodate the           14:50:34

        18      number of CTBs that you see up there.  We               14:50:38

        19      actually think that we can increase the                 14:50:42

        20      efficiency of the cargo stowage inside the              14:50:43

        21      module -- and we're working on plans to do that         14:50:49

        22      now -- to carry more CTBs as well as carry them         14:50:51


                                                              257



         1      more efficiently and more securely.                     14:50:55

         2                We can also support powered payloads          14:50:59

         3      and hard-mounted payloads as required as the            14:51:02

         4      manifest shapes up.  Next slide.                        14:51:05

         5                The service module itself in an               14:51:06

         6      expanded view shows you the various components.         14:51:10

         7      It's fairly standard spacecraft components.             14:51:14

         8      They come from a variety of providers integrated        14:51:19

         9      by Orbital at our facility in Dulles and tested         14:51:23

        10      there, and then the entire spacecraft will be           14:51:28

        11      finally assembled at Wallops itself after               14:51:31

        12      integrated testing and environmental testing,           14:51:35

        13      which we also do at Dulles.  Next slide.                14:51:37

        14                One feature of our vehicle is the PROX        14:51:40

        15      system.  Similar to Elines Coo-coo (phonetic),          14:51:44

        16      it will allow us to do the rendezvous and               14:51:48

        17      approach to the station.  It's based on the same        14:51:51


        18      system that the HTV is using.                           14:51:51

        19                So there's some legacy there as well          14:51:53

        20      as the ability for NASA to monitor the                  14:51:54

        21      performance both systems on both spacecraft and         14:51:59

        22      to learn from them so that we can, as we move           14:52:01


                                                              258



         1      down the road, increase capabilities for                14:52:04

         2      providing cargo as well as other vehicles more          14:52:06

         3      efficiently and safely to the Space Station.            14:52:10

         4      Next slide.                                             14:52:14

         5                The Cygnus will approach in free              14:52:14

         6      flight to a point about ten meters away from the        14:52:18

         7      station, at which point it will be grappled by          14:52:22

         8      the station's arm and installed on the node and         14:52:23

         9      the hatch opened for -- next slide -- for               14:52:26

        10      unloading of the cargo.                                 14:52:29

        11                You can see it will be berthed at             14:52:31

        12      Node 2.                                                 14:52:35

        13                We plan on being there for two to four        14:52:36

        14      weeks, depending on the requirements of the crew        14:52:39

        15      and how long it takes to unload as well as to           14:52:42

        16      load it with the material that will be discarded        14:52:45

        17      during de-orbit.  Next slide.                           14:52:48

        21                And then also, of course, we can carry        14:52:58

        22      both powered stowage lockers, to a certain              14:53:01

         6      The left-hand side is elements of the station           14:53:18

         7      crew presence that need to be discarded                 14:53:21

         8      periodically from the station, kittoes and              14:53:26

         9      yedevaze (phonetic), some of which are                  14:53:27

        10      carried -- most of which are carried back on            14:53:30

        11      Progress now, but with six people up there, they        14:53:32

        12      need to be discarded more frequently.  And we           14:53:35

        13      hope that everything in them burns up before it         14:53:36

        14      gets back to Earth.                                     14:53:37

        15                But that will be a part of our job --         14:53:39

        16      is to help offload the hardware and waste from          14:53:41

        17      the station and dispose of it in the atmosphere.        14:53:45

        18      Next slide.                                             14:53:45

        19                And we did bid on and have the                14:53:52

        20      capability to develop both unpressurized and            14:53:52

        21      return cargo capability.  We've not been tasked         14:53:56

        22      to do that yet by NASA.  If that were to happen         14:53:57


                                                              260



         1      in the future, then we would get to work on that        14:54:00

         2      and provide that capability on a reasonable             14:54:03

         3      schedule along with what we plan to do today.           14:54:05

         4                We do think that the work that we're          14:54:09

         5      doing today is very important for the future of         14:54:12

         6      human space flight from this country.                   14:54:16

         7      Maintaining an American presence on the                 14:54:22

         8      International Space Station -- a robust American        14:54:23

         9      presence on the station and being able to supply        14:54:23

        10      them is very critical, especially with the              14:54:27

        11      transportation gap of the shuttle finishing its         14:54:30

        12      missions.                                               14:54:33

        13                Keeping that presence up there is             14:54:34

        14      going to be watched by the rest of the world,           14:54:35

        15      watched by our own industry and our own young           14=
:54:38

        16      people as they make decisions on where they want        14:54:43

        17      to go with their futures and whether they want          14:54:46

        18      to go into technology and whether they have a           14:54:48

        19      place to go in space.  So even though cargo             14:54:51

        20      doesn't seem like a glamorous profession to be          14:54:53

        21      in to start with, it's just one of the elements         14:54:53

        22      that we have to maintain in order to keep people        14:54:57


                                                              261



         1      flying in space and to keep this country                14:54:59

         2      maintaining the Space Station that we have              14:55:02

         3      invested so much in.  Next slide.                       14:55:04

         4                To summarize the status of our COTS           14:55:06

         5      program, we've completed 10 out of our 21               14:55:11

         6      milestones, system level PDR is complete and            14:55:13

         7      Phase I of the Safety Review Panel is complete,         14:55:17

         8      with Phase II coming up in about two months.            14:55:20

         9                We changed, as I said, from                   14:55:23

        10      unpressurized cargo to pressurized cargo and            14:55:26

        11      then updated the Space Act to reflect that and          14:55:28

        12      changed the mission schedule from late '10 to           14:55:31

        13      early '11 to reflect the additional work                14:55:33

        14      required to execute that.                               14:55:36

        15                For CRS we completed the first two            14:55:37

        16      milestones for the cargo resupply service, and          14:55:42

        17      the next major milestone will be the Vehicle            14:55:45

        18      Baseline Review at L minus 13 months.                   14:55:47

        19                And we are currently working the cargo        14:55:50

        20      manifesting process with NASA to ensure that we         14:55:52

        21      understand not only what they're going to fly           14:55:56

        22      but how they want it stowed and how they want it        14:55:59


                                                              262



         1      unloaded and how they want it handled in space.         14:56:01

         2      Next slide.                                             14:56:05


         3                And this is an overview of our                14:56:05

         4      schedule, as I've already described it, and you         14:56:08

         5      can see the dates on there for reference                14:56:10

         6      purposes.  Next slide.                                  14:56:14

         7                To summarize, I'd like to say, again,         14:56:14

         8      that even though it's not glamorous carrying            14:56:18

         9      cargo it is glamorous for our people to be              14:56:23

        10      working on the Human Space Flight program, and          14:56:26

        11      they've very excited about being a part of this,        14:56:28

        12      being a part of the International Space Station         14:56:33

        13      and helping to continue that mission.                   14:56:33

        14                Because we know that even as we are           14:56:36

        15      working to achieve other goals in space,                14:56:39

        16      maintaining our presence on the International           14:56:42

        17      Space Station keeps the interest up, it keeps           14:56:45

        18      the attention on space and it keeps Americans           14:56:48

        19      flying.  That cannot be overemphasized, I               14:56:51

        20      believe.                                                14:56:54

        21                Evolving that capability to                   14:56:54

        22      understanding what it will take to go further in        14:56:56


                                                              263



         1      space, to live longer in space and to take those        14:56:59

         2      capabilities further out from low Earth orbit           14:57:01

         3      requires the delivery of this cargo and the             14:57:04

         4      delivery of the experiments, and we intend to do        14:57:06

         5      that successfully and to do it cost effectively         14:57:09

         6      and efficiently and, most importantly, safely.          14:57:12

         7                So with that, Mr. Chairman, any               14:57:15

         8      questions?                                              14:57:18

         9                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          14:57:19

        10      Are there questions?                                    14:57:20

        11                I guess you've answered the questions.        14:57:24

        12      We thank you for the briefing.                          14:57:26


        13                MR. CULBERTSON:  Thank you very much          14:57:28

        14      for your attention.                                     14:57:31

        15                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Let's see.  Mike              14:57:31

        16      Suffredini is next, the ISS program manager, who        14:57:31

        17      will talk to us a little bit about commercial           14:57:31

        18      resupply services from his perspective.                 14:57:31

        19                MR. SUFFREDINI:  Good afternoon,              14:57:44

        20      Mr. Chairman and Members of Committee.  It's            14:57:46

        21      good to see you guys here this afternoon.               14:57:48

        22                And just last night or this morning           14:57:51


                                                              264



         1      early I was sitting over in Florida hoping John         14:57:54

         2      would launch the shuttle so we'd get on with the        14:57:57

         3      rest of assembly, but, anyway, we're going to           14:58:01

         4      try that again in July and we're looking forward        14:58:01

         5      to it.                                                  14:58:01

         6                Before I go on, I made a huge error.          14:58:02

         7      Elon reminded me in looking at his paragraphs of        14:58:05

         8      actual hardware that I should have done the same        14:58:09

         9      with Space Station, but Frank's Chart 25, if you        14:58:11

        10      look at that, that's not an artist's rendition          14:58:13

        11      of what ISS is going to look like.  That is a           14:58:15

        12      photograph of the Space Station, and it is              14:58:19

        13      largely complete, as we know it today.                  14:58:21

        14                It is also manned as recently as late         14:58:24

        15      May with a six-person crew.  And so we're               14:58:27

        16      continuing on in that program, and, of course, a        14:58:29

        17      very important part of that -- an important part        14:58:32

        18      of that is the ability to resupply and to get           14:58:33

        19      utilization on board so we can utilize the              14:58:36

        20      vehicle that we built.  And so I thought I'd            14:58:40

        21      spend a little time talking to you about that           14:58:42

        22      today.  Next chart, please.                             14:58:45


                                                              265




         1                Of course, we all know we are going to        14:58:46

         2      retire the shuttle.  The plan is to retire it at        14:58:49

         3      the end of 2010, and what that left us with was         14:58:52

         4      a significant gap in our capability to the              14:58:56

         5      resources to orbit between the time it retires          14:59:00

         6      and, at that time, the planned life of the              14:59:03

         7      International Space Station, which is -- our            14:59:06

         8      plan is to operate through the end of 2015 and          14:59:08

         9      then de-orbit it in the first quarter of 2016.          14:59:11

        10                And what we ended up with through our         14:59:14

        11      analysis is we found out we needed about                14:59:15

        12      60 metric tons of upmass.  And when we look at          14:59:18

        13      the vehicles that we have today that are                14:59:23

        14      available to us or will be available to us soon,        14:59:25

        15      we have, of course, we all know, the Russian            14:59:27

        16      Progress vehicle for cargo and the Soyuz vehicle        14:59:30

        17      for crew.                                               14:59:32

        18                We recently had the first flight of           14:59:32

        19      the automated transfer vehicle, which is the            14:59:36

        20      European contribution to payback which we               14:59:39

        21      call -- what we call common systems ops cost,           14:59:41

        22      and that's going to be four vehicles -- four            14:59:44


                                                              266



         1      more vehicles, the first one plus four.  And            14:59:46

         2      that will be each year starting in '10.  So '10,        14:59:49

         3      '11, '12, '13 will have an ATV vehicle.                 14:59:52

         4                In addition to that, we're about to           14:59:58

         5      fly our first H-II transfer vehicle, which is           15:00:00

         6      the JAXA contribution, also as a payback for            15:00:01

         7      common systems ops costs.  That will be one per         15:00:05

         8      year through the life of the program, starting          15:00:05

         9      with their first flight, which is going to occur        15:00:08

        10      here in September.                                      15:00:10


        11                Now, all of those vehicles together           15:00:12

        12      flying through those times that I just told you         15:00:15

        13      about, we still have a 60-metric-ton shortfall.         15:00:17

        14                In addition to that -- and you've             15:00:21

        15      heard folks talk about it today -- we also have         15:00:22

        16      a need to get crew to orbit.  To date, of               15:00:23

        17      course, the shuttle had done that for us prior          15:00:26

        18      to the accident.  We kind of evolved to doing           15:00:29

        19      most of the crew transport needs with the Soyuz         15:00:32

        20      spacecraft, although we still -- up into the            15:00:35

        21      next couple of flights, we have one crew member         15:00:38

        22      that we do rotate on the shuttle.                       15:00:39


                                                              267



         1                And then the future, of course, for           15:00:42

         2      now shows us having to procure those seats until        15:00:45

         3      the crew exploration vehicle is available, and          15:00:50

         4      the first flight where we can take six crew to          15:00:52

         5      orbit and it stays on orbit as a rescue is              15:00:55

         6      currently the fall of 2015.                             15:00:55

         7                We have procured Soyuz spacecraft             15:01:00

         8      through the fall of 2012 with the return in             15:01:02

         9      2013, and so we do have a gap there that we             15:01:05

        10      haven't procured to date.  Next chart, please.          15:01:07

        11                So this chart -- you've seen it               15:01:11

        12      before.  This kind of just shows you the                15:01:14

        13      different capabilities.  A couple of points I           15:01:17

        14      would make on this chart.                               15:01:20

        15                The first is you'll note that no              15:01:21

        16      vehicle other than the space shuttle is able to         15:01:23

        17      return unpressurized cargo.  And that was a             15:01:26

        18      significant change for us.  That drove us to go         15:01:29

        19      to a -- what we refer to as the build-and-burn          15:01:31

        20      philosophy.                                             15:01:34

        21                Prior to this time, we built a limited        15:01:35


        22      number of orbit replacement units or basically          15:01:37


                                                              268



         1      spare components, and when they failed, the             15:01:39

         2      intention was to return them home and repair            15:01:41

         3      them and fly them back up when we needed them.          15:01:43

         4                The external ORUs are all very -- I           15:01:47

         5      wouldn't say all -- they're mostly all very,            15:01:50

         6      very larger components, very heavy, and there           15:01:53

         7      was just -- there was no capability at the time         15:01:56

         8      or planned capability we knew of to be able to          15:01:59

         9      handle the external ORUs.  And, in fact, that's         15:02:01

        10      holding true today.  Nobody is planning to do a         15:02:06

        11      return capability external ORUs.                        15:02:10

        12                In addition to that, you'll see if we         15:02:13

        13      hadn't gone with the commercial resupply                15:02:16

        14      services contract that there wasn't even a              15:02:18

        15      capability to bring a significant amount of             15:02:21

        16      pressurized cargo home.                                 15:02:24

        17                The Soyuz does bring home a little bit        15:02:26

        18      per our contract.  For each seat we get about           15:02:26

        19      17 kilograms in a very confined space so we can         15:02:28

        20      bring home some samples, water samples,                 15:02:31

        21      experiment samples, but it's fairly limited.            15:02:35

        22      And so we needed that capability as well.               15:02:37


                                                              269



         1                Now, the HTV does have -- it was at           15:02:40

         2      the time -- before CRS, HTV was the only vehicle        15:02:43

         3      that also had an upmass capability through her          15:02:48

         4      external ORUs.  So now we still have to get the         15:02:52

         5      spares to orbit.  HTV was going to be the only          15:02:52

         6      capability to do that.  And this is something we        15:02:56

         7      also got more capability with the CRS contract.         15:02:59

         8                So you can see -- just that chart             15:03:03


         9      alone kind of makes you realize how big of an           15:03:05

        10      impact that losing shuttle did to us.                   15:03:09

        11                Now, you have to remember much of the         15:03:12

        12      shuttle capability -- the whole program was             15:03:14

        13      built around assembly, and, of course, much that        15:03:14

        14      of capability that we utilize on shuttle has            15:03:17

        15      been for assembly as well.  So it's hard to             15:03:19

        16      compare apples to apples on this chart just from        15:03:22

        17      a pure upmass standpoint.  Next chart.                  15:03:25

        18                So all of this drove us to go into a          15:03:27

        19      procurement of a capability to take care of the         15:03:31

        20      remaining 60 metric tons that we had to procure         15:03:33

        21      in order to operate the ISS through 2015.  I            15:03:37

        22      won't go through all of these charts.                   15:03:41


                                                              270



         1                But we did do a lengthy process to            15:03:42

         2      involve commercial -- the industry early on to          15:03:46

         3      understand what they could and couldn't do, what        15:03:49

         4      was reasonable to expect.  We were into a fixed         15:03:52

         5      price contract.  We wanted to understand the            15:03:55

         6      application of that capability.                         15:03:56

         7                All of that drove us to an RFP on             15:03:57

         8      April 14.  And you can see down here at the             15:04:01

         9      bottom it showed you basically what we put in as        15:04:04

        10      the need that the RFP was trying to fulfill.            15:04:07

        11                You'll notice it has upmass, both             15:04:10

        12      internal and external.  It has only pressurized         15:04:13

        13      return, because that was the only capability we         15:04:17

        14      thought we could get in a return capability, and        15:04:19

        15      then this disposal downmass, which is just a            15:04:22

        16      nice way of saying trash -- Frank mentioned             15:04:25

        17      earlier.  Next chart, please.                           15:04:28

        18                This chart -- we spent a lot of time          15:04:29

        19      trying to decide what we could do and when we           15:04:32

        20      should do it.  This chart is showing -- it says         15:04:35

        21      it here in the title, Using 2008 Historical             15:04:38

        22      Schedule Dates.                                         15:04:41


                                                              271



         1                So in late 2007 we were trying to             15:04:42

         2      decide when to do the procurement.  And this            15:04:46

         3      chart just kind shows you at this time RPK was          15:04:48

         4      out of the picture.  The COTS Phase I second            15:04:51

         5      re-award, if you will, hadn't taken place.  So          15:04:54

         6      we knew what the SpaceX plan was going to be.           15:04:59

         7                We also knew from talking to our JAXA         15:05:03

         8      colleagues that they needed about a 36-month            15:05:06

         9      lead time to build an HTV.  If we ask for one,          15:05:08

        10      they need about 36 months.  And, of course, we          15:05:10

        11      need additional time just to do the negotiations        15:05:11

        12      before the 36-month clock started.                      15:05:14


        13                In addition to that, we found in              15:05:18

        14      talking to industry that it would probably take         15:05:20

        15      about two years to get any vehicle that we              15:05:23

        16      wanted.  So if we ordered, we had to always             15:05:27

        17      order about two years in advance.  And that's           15:05:30

        18      been true for the Progress vehicle as well.             15:05:32

        19      It's a pretty standard time.  The human-rated           15:05:34

        20      spacecraft tend to take a little longer, and            15:05:37

        21      that's also born out from our purchase of the           15:05:39

        22      Soyuz spacecraft.                                       15:05:42


                                                              272



         1                But in any event, 2011 -- early 2011          15:05:44

         2      is when we decided was the deadline to have             15:05:45

         3      capability to orbit.  And I'll talk a little bit        15:05:49

         4      about the challenges associated with any                15:05:52

         5      movement to the right of schedule here in a             15:05:54

         6      minute.  But that drove us then to do the               15:05:56

         7      acquisition when we did.  Next chart, please.           15:05:59

         8                This was going to be a new way of             15:06:04

         9      doing business, at least for us anyway.  We're          15:06:07

        10      used to doing cost-plus contracts, controlling          15:06:10

        11      every aspect of the process.                            15:06:13

        12                And we also are fairly hands-on even          15:06:14

        13      in ELV land in terms of what we watch and what          15:06:18

        14      data we get back, and we even give a go at              15:06:21

        15      launch time.  And we were trying to change to           15:06:26

        16      a -- to a little more closer to the type of             15:06:28

        17      fixed price contract you'd expect.  It's an             15:06:30

        18      end-to-end service type contract.                       15:06:33

        19                In all of these cases, we supply an           15:06:35

        20      ORU or a bag of supplies to the provider and the        15:06:38

        21      provider gives it back to us when we get on             15:06:43

        22      Space Station.  And so it's an end-to-end               15:06:45


                                                              273



         1      service.                                                15:06:48

         2                Now, to the extent we could let go of         15:06:48

         3      the launch vehicle we have, we got relatively           15:06:50

         4      hands-off in terms of the launch vehicle prep           15:06:54

         5      and what they have to do to ensure mission              15:06:56

         6      success.  There's still work they have to do            15:07:01

         7      working with the range and FAA to assure safety         15:07:03

         8      for the people on the ground, but once you get          15:07:05

         9      past that point, it's really up to these                15:07:07

        10      contractors to ensure that they're going to be          15:07:09

        11      successful and get to ISS.                              15:07:12

        12                And then we have this sphere around           15:07:14

        13      ISS -- about a two-by-two-by-four kilometer             15:07:17

        14      sphere around ISS, and anything that the                15:07:18

        15      spacecraft does inside that sphere, including           15:07:21

        16      the burn to get to that sphere, then is a little        15:07:24


        17      more tightly controlled, more like you'd expect         15:07:26

        18      NASA would do.  But it really was only from a           15:07:31

        19      safety aspect.                                          15:07:31

        20                Anything to do with mission success,          15:07:31

        21      we took off those kinds of requirements we              15:07:31

        22      normally apply, and we applied just the                 15:07:35


                                                              274



         1      requirements having to do with safety in order          15:07:37

         2      to ensure that we would be safe.  But the whole         15:07:39

         3      idea was to put the monkey on the back of the           15:07:42

         4      provider to get to ISS and try to take some of          15:07:44

         5      our work out of that process.                           15:07:47

         6                So it's a contract for fixed price, as        15:07:49

         7      I said here, for the internal/external upmass           15:07:52

         8      and the cargo return and cargo disposal.  And in        15:07:56

         9      the end, we ended up selecting two vendors              15:07:56

        10      inside this contract.  We had the option to             15:08:00

        11      select one, two -- even could do more than two,         15:08:01

        12      if we chose.  Of course, more than two, you             15:08:05

        13      probably -- you'd run into a problem of having          15:08:06

        14      enough business to entice a contractor to play.         15:08:09

        15                We felt like we needed at least two.          15:08:13

        16      Because in the cases of what were proposed to           15:08:16

        17      us, it was always -- it was all new vehicle, and        15:08:19

        18      so we felt like we needed some redundancy there         15:08:21

        19      to hope that if -- if two applied, we would, of         15:08:25

        20      course, hope both will be successful, but if            15:08:28

        21      they don't, we still have a chance that one             15:08:30

        22      might be enough to keep us going until we get           15:08:33


                                                              275



         1      other capability to orbit.  Next chart, please.         15:08:37

         2                So this is the result of the task             15:08:38

         3      order after we awarded the contract in late             15:08:41

         4      December.  In about the March time frame we sat         15:08:41


         5      down with both companies and did what we call           15:08:44

         6      our task orders, and this is basically how the          15:08:46

         7      flights worked out.  We put the year and month          15:08:48

         8      and kind of laid them out.                              15:08:51

         9                And then as we get closer in, within          15:08:53

        10      about two years, we'll do ATP.  And at about            15:08:56

        11      18 months then we'll actually select the launch         15:09:00

        12      date and a 90-day period that they have to lunch        15:09:02

        13      within, and we'll agree to that at this Vehicle         15:09:05

        14      Baseline Review that has occurred in one case           15:09:10

        15      and is to occur here shortly, as Frank                  15:09:14

        16      mentioned.  Next chart, please.                         15:09:17

        17                So this just kind of gives you a sense        15:09:17

        18      of the two-year window and how the flights line         15:09:22

        19      up.  The red X's are the actual launch dates,           15:09:26

        20      and then the bar there is the time from ATP to          15:09:30

        21      launch.  And it just kind of gives you a feel           15:09:33

        22      for where everything lays out.                          15:09:36

         1                Remember I told you the beginning of          15:09:39

         2      2011 is when we wanted to be able to have cargo         15:09:41

         3      to orbit.  And the current plan for the COTS            15:09:46

         4      part of this process was not to carry cargo to          15:09:50

         5      ISS.  So the first cargo on either of the two           15:09:52

         6      vehicles was going to be on the SpaceX vehicle          15:09:54

         7      in late 2010.  So when we made the award, we            15:09:56

         8      were already kind of late relative to our needs.        15:10:00

         9      Next chart, please.                                     15:10:03

        10                So I won't get into too much detail on        15:10:03

        11      these next two charts in order to save time, but        15:10:08

        12      you can kind of see the milestones that are             15:10:11

        13      listed here.                                            15:10:13

        14                We're coupled very closely to the COTS        15:10:14


        15      effort.  The COTS program really manages the            15:10:16

        16      relationship with Orbital and SpaceX.  All of           15:10:21

        17      the integration work, all of the requirement,           15:10:24

        18      all of that is supplied by and verified by the          15:10:25

        19      International Space Station program, and that           15:10:28

        20      ensures that when the COTS flight occurs and if         15:10:29

        21      it is successful then transitioning to the CRS          15:10:33

        22      flight should be relatively seamless.  Next             15:10:38

         1      chart, please.                                          15:10:42

         2                And this is just the specifics for the        15:10:42

         3      Orbital flight as well.  You'll notice there's a        15:10:44

         4      little bit of difference to Orbital, and Frank          15:10:48

         5      mentioned it.  They have a solid second stage           15:10:49

         6      early in their program, and after the first             15:10:52

         7      couple of flights, they go to a liquid stage            15:10:55

         8      which provides more performance.                        15:11:00

         9                And as the last two bullets say --            15:11:01

        10      really this is a challenging business, at best.         15:11:02

        11      It is a very difficult business.  We all in this        15:11:05

        12      room -- most of us in this room have a lot of           15:11:08

        13      experience with this, and no matter how well we         15:11:11

        14      plan and how hard we work and how much money we         15:11:14

        15      put into it, there are always challenges to             15:11:18

        16      overcome.                                               15:11:20

        17                And even once you become operational,         15:11:21

        18      until you've flown a few times, you're still            15:11:23

        19      going to have challenges making schedule.  And          15:11:28

        20      so we believe that even once we do the VBR we           15:11:31

        21      need to be prepared for slips as much as three          15:11:36

        22      to six months and maybe more.  Next chart,              15:11:39


                                                              278



         1      please.                                                 15:11:42

         2                So this chart is an attempt to show           15:11:42


         3      you what the logistics are on board that we have        15:11:44

         4      to provide for on the International Space               15:11:47

         5      Station through the end of 2011.  And I'll try          15:11:49

         6      to talk to you a little bit in large detail.            15:11:53

         7                The green line is the crew supply.  So        15:11:56

         8      that's water, food, clothing -- all of the              15:11:59

         9      things that the crew needs to survive.                  15:12:01

        10                The orange line is consumables.  So           15:12:05

        11      those are filters, tanks -- those big tanks you         15:12:08

        12      saw Frank show, those kinds of things are the           15:12:10

        13      consumables required to operate the systems for         15:12:11

        14      the crew.                                               15:12:14

        15                The dashed purple line is the                 15:12:15

        16      utilization requirements, and you can see even          15:12:17

        17      today with the capability we have because of            15:12:19

        18      assembly we're challenged early in 2010 to meet         15:12:21

        19      the needs of the utilization crowd.                     15:12:26

        20                And then, finally, the light gray is          15:12:29

        21      corrective maintenance.  And so even as we plan         15:12:30

        22      today, we're relatively challenged to do the            15:12:33


                                                              279



         1      corrective maintenance.  Now, that's not a bad          15:12:36

         2      thing.  This is all based on meantime between           15:12:39

         3      failure.                                                15:12:41

         4                Our meantime between failures on the          15:12:41

         5      majority of our components have been very               15:12:44

         6      friendly to us.  And as you can expect, early in        15:12:45

         7      the life of the Space Station, these systems are        15:12:47

         8      relatively young, and we would expect that we           15:12:49

         9      will continue to have positive performance from         15:12:56

        10      the hardware relative to failures.                      15:12:57

        11                However, as the vehicle gets older,           15:13:00

        12      you wouldn't want to carry this kind of                 15:13:02


        13      challenge because you can expect more failures          15:13:04

        14      as they get closer to their design life.                15:13:07

        15                Now, what we have done in the program         15:13:10

        16      to try to mitigate the risk of the potential for        15:13:12

        17      these vehicles to move to the right are two             15:13:16

        18      things.                                                 15:13:19

        19                One is -- you see the dots that               15:13:19

        20      represent both of the demo flight -- the demo           15:13:21

        21      flights that actually berth to the ISS, so              15:13:22

                                                              280



         1      and then you see the first couple of flights for        15:13:29

         2      SpaceX there and that first CRS flight for              15:13:29

         3      Orbital.  None of that upmass is accommodated in        15:13:33

         4      that chart.                                             15:13:37

         5                So what that chart tells you is we            15:13:37

         6      could probably keep the ISS flying and utilize          15:13:40

         7      it the way we expect to utilize it through about        15:13:43

         8      the end of 2011, and at that point if we don't          15:13:46

         9      have some upmass from one of these systems,             15:13:50

        10      we're going to be challenged to continue to             15:13:52

        11      utilize ISS in the long term.                           15:13:54

        12                Now, I'll tell you a couple of things.        15:13:58

        13      One is, of course, I told you that we don't --          15:13:59

        14      we haven't accommodated any upmass.  So I               15:14:01

        15      haven't assumed any upmass from any of those            15:14:01

        16      vehicles.  And second of all, even though the           15:14:07

        17      demos today are not intended to carry flight            15:14:08

        18      hardware to orbit, one of the things we're              15:14:12

        19      looking at is we want to make sure the demo is          15:14:14

        20      as realistic as possible.                               15:14:17

        21                In order to do that, we believe we            15:14:19

        22      should manifest those vehicles as if they're            15:14:21


                                                              281




         1      flying as real vehicles, and it's all about how         15:14:24

         2      you pack it and how you're going to -- once you         15:14:26

         3      get to orbit, how you're going to unpack it and         15:14:29

         4      how you're going to fill it back up with trash.         15:14:32

         5                And so we believe that we have a              15:14:34

         6      rationale to go ahead and manifest flight               15:14:36

         7      hardware on the -- from the demonstration               15:14:38

         8      flights as well.  So that's another mitigation.         15:14:39

         9      If any one of these flights makes it between now        15:14:39

        10      and the end of 2011, that's just more margin for        15:14:44

        11      us to continue on.                                      15:14:46

        12                So our job is to try to manage the ISS        15:14:48

        13      such that we can give as much to both Orbital           15:14:52

        14      and SpaceX to move to the right as they                 15:14:56

        15      naturally -- as you might expect them to have to        15:14:58

        16      as they conquer problems.                               15:15:02

        17                Part of that, of course, is working           15:15:05

        18      very closely with them not to let other slips           15:15:06

        19      occur.  So you want to manage really hard to            15:15:08

        20      your milestones so you can deal with those              15:15:09

        21      problems that you're not expecting to have.  And        15:15:10

        22      so that's part of what we've been working               15:15:14


                                                              282



         1      closely with both SpaceX and Orbital to talk            15:15:17

         2      about.                                                  15:15:18

         3                And I'll just tell you up front right         15:15:19

         4      now, both companies have done just a great job          15:15:21

         5      of working with us and designing their systems          15:15:24

         6      and understanding our requirements, and we've           15:15:26

         7      been very impressed so far.  We just know that          15:15:30

         8      the challenge is there no matter how good you           15:15:33

         9      are.  Next chart, please.                               15:15:37

        10                So this is really my summary chart.           15:15:38


        11      We selected two contracts to get us some                15:15:44

        12      mitigation to the possibility if one or the             15:15:44

        13      other didn't quite make it.                             15:15:47

        14                We're working very closely with the --        15:15:49

        15      they call themselves C3PO, the office that              15:15:51

        16      manages the COTS program on behalf of the ESMD          15:15:55

        17      and, in fact, are doing all of the integration          15:15:57

        18      work for the COTS program to ensure that the            15:16:00

        19      COTS vehicles then can seamlessly become CRS            15:16:03

        20      vehicle when that occurs.                               15:16:07

        21                We have great insight into their              15:16:09

        22      milestones and are working closely with them            15:16:11


                                                              283



         1      when we see challenges coming along.  And while         15:16:13

         2      the contractors do have quite a bit of work             15:16:15

         3      ahead of them, we think they're doing a great,          15:16:17

         4      great job, but we would expect schedule slips,          15:16:19

         5      as you normally would.  And we're working hard          15:16:22

         6      to help mitigate those, as we mentioned earlier.        15:16:25

         7                And that concludes my presentation,           15:16:28

         8      Mr. Chairman, and I'm ready to take any                 15:16:30

         9      questions you might have.                               15:16:32

        10                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Terrific.              15:16:33

        11      Thanks very much, Mike.                                 15:16:36

        12                Questions from anybody?                       15:16:37

        13                Okay.  Jeff...                                15:16:39

        14                MR. GREASON:  Back on your Chart 11, I        15:16:39

        15      assume these jagged lines are your demand as to         15:16:41

        16      what you want to fly?                                   15:16:46

        17                MR. SUFFREDINI:  That's what we will          15:16:48

        18      fly.                                                    15:16:49

        19                MR. GREASON:  That's what you will            15:16:49

        20      fly?                                                    15:16:49

        21                MR. SUFFREDINI:  Yes, sir.                    15=
:16:50

        22                MR. GREASON:  Okay.  I'm at a loss as         15:16:52


                                                              284



         1      to how things like -- in 2010, for example, how         15:16:55

         2      does the consumable -- how do some of these             15:16:57

         3      items like ISS utilization get negative?                15:16:58

         4                MR. SUFFREDINI:  They get negative            15:17:01

         5      when you know you're not supplying at the               15:17:02

         6      level -- zero represents what we believe we need        15:17:04

         7      to be above to meet the needs of different              15:17:07

         8      suppliers.                                              15:17:10

         9                MR. GREASON:  This would basically be         15:17:10

        10      the margin you have?                                    15:17:10

        11                MR. SUFFREDINI:  Right.                       15:17:11

        12                MR. GREASON:  Okay.  Got you.                 15:17:10

        13                MR. SUFFREDINI:  So in this case we're        15:17:11

        14      trying to meet the needs of utilization folks.          15:17:14

        15      I'll tell you, that dip is for -- I'll say for          15:17:18

        16      utilization resupply.  So all of the racks and          15:17:20

        17      capability that we need to put on orbit to use          15:17:23

        18      in the future, that all does make it to orbit.          15:17:26

        19                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Please go ahead, Bo.          15:17:30

        20                MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you.                       15:17:32

        21                Michael, when we listen today to              15:17:34

        22      Mr. Perminov, the Russian space agency head, he         15:17:36


                                                              285



         1      didn't seem to be concerned about the fact that         15:17:42

         2      NASA budget for support to International Space          15:17:45

         3      Station today is not planned beyond 2016.               15:17:48

         4                I haven't heard any concern from              15:17:52

         5      either of the COTS contractors either, your             15:17:54

         6      suppliers, and I'm thinking:  Is it that just           15:17:58

         7      everybody assumes that America and NASA will            15:18:01

         8      come to its senses and figure out how to fund it        15:18:06


         9      past 2016, or are these guys in it for short            15:18:09

        10      run?  What am I missing?                                15:18:15

        11                (Discussion off the record.)                  15:17:11

        12                MR. SUFFREDINI:  Good.  I was about to        15:17:11

        13      say we should ask him.  So there's Frank up             15:18:20

        14      there.  He's going -- yes.  Well, I'll tell you         15:18:23

        15      what my conversations are, and then I would             15:18:24

        16      encourage you to get --                                 15:18:25

        17                MR. BEJMUK:  Well, you work with all          15:18:25

        18      of these guys, you know.                                15:17:11

        19                MR. SUFFREDINI:  -- Frank and Elon --         15:17:11

        20      let Frank and Elon come up here and talk, and I         15:18:29

        21      think Anatolli (phonetic) is gone.                      15:18:32

        22                But all of the partners expressed to          15:18:33


                                                              286



         1      us that they have made a major investment in            15:18:35

         2      ISS.  And, in fact, in the Russians' case, they         15:18:38

         3      want to build yet another module, and they kind         15:18:40

         4      of don't want to do that if it's only going to          15:18:40

         5      be on orbit for two or three years.  That's a           15:18:43

         6      major investment for two or three years.                15:18:44

         7                So our discussions with the partners          15:18:46

         8      has been they would like to see us go beyond            15:18:48

         9      2015.                                                   15:18:52

        10                Now, as far as SpaceX and Orbital go,         15:18:52

        11      I've got to believe, based on the way the               15:18:56

        12      contract is written, that they would like to see        15:18:58

        13      the opportunity to defray more of the costs that        15:19:00

        14      they made in their first investment to get to           15:19:02

        15      where they are and see us fly more so they could        15:19:02

        16      do more resupply.                                       15:19:06

        17                But Frank and Elon would have to              15:19:07

        18      comment.  If you'd like.                                15:19:10


        19                UNKNOWN SPEAKER:  Yeah.                       15:17:11

        20                MR. SUFFREDINI:  Was I close?  Did I          15:17:11

        21      get it right?                                           15:17:11

         1                UNKNOWN SPEAKER:  We think, as I said,        15:17:11

         2      maintaining the human presence in space is              15:17:11

         3      extremely important for this country,                   15:19:25

         4      particularly if we're going to go beyond low            15:19:25

         5      Earth orbit, and we want to keep the programs           15:19:25

         6      going, particularly this one going.  We've got a        15:19:32

         7      lot invested in ISS, and our partners have a lot        15:19:32

         8      invested in it.  Going beyond 2016, I think, is         15:19:35

         9      a very important decision that needs to be made         15:19:39

        10      very soon.                                              15:19:42

        11                MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you.                       15:19:42

        12                MR. SUFFREDINI:  Now, we're going to          15:19:45

        13      have lots of opportunities to talk about other          15:19:46

        14      things, and if you ever ask me what I think             15:19:46

        15      about that, it's likely to be even slightly             15:19:46

        16      different than how I answer it for those guys.          15:19:52

        17                MR. AUGUSTINE:  I have a question I           15:19:52

        18      wanted to ask.  From October 2010 to -- for five        15:19:54

        19      years or thereabouts, the current plan would be         15:19:58

        20      depend on the Russians to put astronauts on the         15:20:02

        21      station.                                                15:20:07

        22                If I go backwards in time from October        15:20:07


                                                              288



         1      of 2010, there's one more mission that carries a        15:20:10

         2      crew with the shuttle -- is that right -- one           15:20:14

         3      remaining?                                              15:17:11

         4                MR. SUFFREDINI:  Two more.                    15:17:11

         5                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Oh, there are two             15:20:17

         6      remaining missions?                                     15:17:11


         7                MR. SUFFREDINI:  2J, which is on the          15:17:11

         8      pad, and 17A, we'll rotate one U.S./Soyuz --            15:20:19

         9                MR. AUGUSTINE:  One beyond that.              15:17:11

        10                MR. SUFFREDINI:  -- crew member, and          15:17:11

        11      then we bring home that crew member on ULF-3.           15:20:23

        12                MR. AUGUSTINE:  And if I take                 15:20:28

        13      literally today and go backwards in time, when          15:20:30

        14      was the previous flight of the shuttle that             15:20:34

        15      carried a crew?                                         15:20:36

        16                MR. SUFFREDINI:  The previous flight.         15:20:37

        17                MR. AUGUSTINE:  There was a previous          15:20:39

        18      flight?                                                 15:20:41

        19                MR. SUFFREDINI:  Uh-huh.                      15:20:41

        20                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Thank you very         15:20:41

        21      much.                                                   15:20:41

        22                MR. SUFFREDINI:  We did the lion's            15:20:42


                                                              289



         1      share of crew rotation on the shuttle until the         15:20:45

         2      accident, and then the Soyuz had to do all of it        15:20:48

         3      until we started flying again.  After we started        15:20:51

         4      flying again, we started putting a single               15:20:54

         5      crew -- doing two on the Soyuz and a single crew        15:20:55

         6      on the shuttle, and we've done that                     15:20:56

         7      semi-consistently for a little while.                   15:20:59

         8                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Got it.  Very good.           15:21:01

         9                Are there any questions?                      15:21:03

        10                Hearing no other questions, well,             15:21:05

        11      thank you very much.                                    15:21:06

        12                MR. SUFFREDINI:  Thank you very much.         15:21:07

        13      I appreciate it.                                        15:21:09

        14                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Let's see.  The next          15:21:13

        15      item concerns alternative architectures.  The           15:21:14

        16      first topic will be Direct.  And, let's see,            15:21:18


        17      Steve Metschan is going to do that.                     15:21:24

        18                Steve...                                      15:21:28

        19                MR. METSCHAN:  Good afternoon,                15:21:37

        20      Mr. Chairman and Members of the Commission.  My         15:21:39

        21      name is a Steve Metschan.  It is my privilege to        15:21:41

        22      present the Direct proposal to you on behalf of         15:21:45


                                                              290



         1      a courageous group of engineers and other               15:21:47

         2      concerned citizens.                                     15:21:51

         3                This began for me four years ago when         15:21:52

         4      NASA asked my company for an analysis of all            15:21:55

         5      possible approaches that could meet the policy          15:22:00

         6      objectives of the VSE -- or the vision within           15:22:03

         7      the available budget.  This analysis was refined        15:22:04

         8      and transformed by a government and industry            15:22:07

         9      experts into the Direct concepts I'm showing            15:22:10

        10      today.  Next slide.                                     15:22:14

        11                The Direct plan is intended to help           15:22:16

        12      put U.S. exploration plans back into alignment          15:22:20

        13      with the approved policy and within the limits          15:22:22

        14      of the available budget.                                15:22:24

        15                The reductions in long-term                   15:22:28

        16      discretionary spending make this even more              15:22:30

        17      imperative today.                                       15:22:34

        18                So what is the Jupiter?                       15:22:36

        19                Jupiter is based on the space shuttle.        15:22:38

        20      The space shuttle is the horse we are currently         15:22:41

        21      riding today into orbit and represents a good           15:22:43

        22      foundation from which to create a new capability        15:22:46


                                                              291



         1      for the future.  Jupiter retains the proven and         15:22:48

         2      already man-rated shuttle main engines and the          15:22:51

         3      solid rocket boosters.                                  15:22:54

         4                Now, ironically the first thing that          15:22:59


         5      all shuttle-derived systems do is they remove           15:22:59

         6      the shuttle, but they retain the heavy-lift             15:23:01

         7      stack that has taken us to orbit now for almost         15:23:05

         8      30 years.                                               15:23:09

         9                The primary modifications to the stack        15:23:09

        10      is to use the tooling at Michoud to actually            15:23:13

        11      produce the oxygen tank to turn it into an              15:23:15

        12      in-line vehicle, in which the core becomes the          15:23:19

        13      carrier for the payload.                                15:23:22

        14                The primary new piece of structure we         15:23:23

        15      need is the aft thrust structure.  We then              15:23:24

        16      replace the shuttle main engines that are               15:23:27

        17      already flying, the existing four-segment               15:23:29

        18      rockets, and we produce what we call the Jupiter        15:23:33

        19      core once we add the payload adapter and the            15:23:36

        20      avionics.                                               15:23:41

        21                Above that we put the payload, which          15:23:42

        22      is completely separate from the spacecraft, so          15:23:44


                                                              292



         1      it does not affect the abort capabilities for           15:23:46

         2      that.  And with the payload fairing, that's our         15:23:47

         3      entry level vehicle, what we call the                   15:23:49

         4      Jupiter-130 or some may want to call it some day        15:23:50

         5      the Ares III.                                           15:23:52

         6                Once you're at that point, we add a           15:23:55

         7      planned addition fourth engine to the core,             15:23:57

         8      which is already designed to handle the                 15:24:01

         9      additional loads associated with an upper stage,        15:24:04

        10      which could be J-2 or RL-6 based.  The avionics         15:24:06

        11      ring is then replaced with the Altair lander,           15:24:09

        12      the payload fairing already developed with              15:24:15

        13      Orion, and that becomes the Ares IV, the                15:24:15

        14      Jupiter-246 in this particular configuration.           15:24:23


        15                Direct is not a new concept.  Even            15:24:25

        16      before the shuttle first flew, NASA engineers           15:24:29

        17      suggested utilizing the hardware and                    15:24:33

        18      infrastructure of the shuttle to develop a              15:24:33

        19      derivative heavy-lift launch system.                    15:24:35

        20                Following Challenger, NASA engineers,         15:24:38

        21      once again, studied this idea in even greater           15:24:40

        22      detail, ultimately recommending the National            15:24:45


                                                              293



         1      Launch System or the NSL, which passed its              15:24:47

         2      preliminary design review milestone in 1993.            15:24:49

         3                Now, in a post-Columbia world, some           15:24:53

         4      NASA engineers have, once again, asserted at            15:24:57

         5      great risk to their livelihood that the best            15:24:59

         6      path forward is still a true direct -- hence,           15:25:04

         7      the name Direct -- shuttle directive.                   15:25:08

         8                Given the imminent destruction of             15:25:11

         9      America's second heavy-lift system and                  15:25:11

        10      infrastructure, this commission will ultimately         15:25:14

        11      help determine if a solution repeatedly                 15:25:17

        12      advocated by NASA engineers over the last               15:25:20

        13      30 years as a practical solution to America's           15:25:23

        14      heavy-lift requirements will ever become                15:25:25

        15      reality.  Next slide.                                   15:25:29

        16                The engineering feasibility, use of           15:25:31

        17      available tooling, flow within the existing             15:25:38

        19      transport of an in-line core has been assessed          15:25:44

        20      in great detail by NASA repeatedly.  In fact,           15:25:47

        21      the National Launch System study produced a             15:25:52

         1      alone had 1,000 pages of detail associated with         15:25:56

         2      the design and how one would accomplish that.           15:25:59


         3                Then, as now, the most time-consuming         15:26:03

         4      and risky element of any rocket development             15:26:06

         5      effort is still the rocket engine, not the tank         15:26:10

         6      structure.  Direct is the only man-ratable              15:26:13

         7      proposal on the table with man-rated rocket             15:26:19

         8      engines already flying; namely, the shuttle main        15:26:19

         9      engines.                                                15:26:23

        10                Now, some have said Direct is nothing         15:26:23

        11      more than paper rocket.  Nothing could be               15:26:29

        12      further from the truth.                                 15:26:31

        13                Currently the Ares I requires a new           15:26:32

        14      five-segment solid rocket booster development.          15:26:35

        15      The Jupiter's four-segment SRB is already flying        15:26:39

        16      on the shuttle.                                         15:26:40

        17                Ares requires a new upper stage engine        15:26:43

        18      development, the J-2X.  The Jupiter's engine,           15:26:46

        19      the shuttle main engine, is already man rated           15:26:50

        20      and flying on the shuttle.                              15:26:53

        21                Ares I is currently struggling to             15:26:55

        22      mitigate the serious thrust oscillation issues          15:26:58

         1      associated with an unproven configuration.  The         15:27:01

         2      Jupiter's configuration utilizes a proven               15:27:02

         3      approach for dampening these vibrations.                15:27:05

         4                The Ares I requires a new launch              15:27:09

         5      infrastructure, whereas the Jupiter uses the            15:27:12

         6      current infrastructure while also incorporating         15:27:17

         7      cost efficient improvements to the current              15:27:17

         8      side-mounted approach.                                  15:27:21

         9                The Ares I requires a staging event,          15:27:23

        10      whereas the Jupiter's main engines are ground           15:27:26

        11      lit just like the shuttle before committing to          15:27:29

        12      the launch.                                             15:27:32


        13                The Ares I lift limitations has               15:27:33

        14      required key safety mission systems and                 15:27:38

        15      redundancy to be eliminated from Orion while            15:27:38

        16      forcing the same to endure an unprecedented             15:27:42

        17      vibrational environment for a lunar spacecraft.         15:27:45

        18      Jupiter has more than enough margin to put all          15:27:49

        19      of these safety systems back in.                        15:27:49

        20                Taken together, all of the development        15:27:54

        21      costs for the Ares I makes it's substantially           15:27:57

        22      more expensive to develop while simultaneously          15:27:59


                                                              296



         1      increasing both schedule risk over the Jupiter.         15:28:03

         2                The bottom line, we believe strongly          15:28:08

         3      that the Jupiter will close the gap within the          15:28:10

         4      current budget.                                         15:28:14

         5                More importantly, see let's what we're        15:28:15

         6      getting for our money.  With Ares -- though I           15:28:18

         7      realize Ares develops a lot of technologies for         15:28:21

         8      the Ares V -- we'll get to that in a second.            15:28:23

         9      But with what we get out of the gate here, with         15:28:25

        10      Ares we spend about $14 billion for a launch            15:28:28

        11      system less capable than what we can buy today,         15:28:31

        12      whereas with the Jupiter, while we spend                15:28:35

        13      $8 billion, we get a launch system that will be         15:28:37

        14      second to none in the world while increasing            15:28:42

        15      substantially the crew safety.                          15:28:46

        16                So let's look at the basic overview           15:28:47

        17      here.                                                   15:28:50

        18                Ultimately even our entry level               15:28:50

        19      Jupiter, which has no upper stage, will offer a         15:28:53

        20      capability that no one else in the world has,           15:28:56

        21      especially in terms of volume capacity.  But            15:28:58

        22      when it comes to lift capacity, we have roughly         15:29:01


                                                              297



         1      three times as much mass performance as the next        15:29:02

         2      largest operational launch system, the Delta IV         15:29:04

         3      Heavy.  Next.                                           15:29:09

         4                It is also important to point out that        15:29:11

         5      the current plan requires the development of an         15:29:14

         6      even larger launch system, the Ares V.  That            15:29:16

         7      promises to bust the budget and will also               15:29:18

         8      require the de-orbiting of the International            15:29:21

         9      Space Station in 2016 in order to free up the           15:29:24

        10      cash necessary to pay for its development.              15:29:27

        11                Under the Direct proposal, the only           15:29:30

        12      new component we require is an upper stage in           15:29:34

        13      order to deliver a sufficiently high                    15:29:37

        14      performance, lower cost and more flexible lunar         15:29:38

        15      architecture enabled by operating one launch            15:29:41

        16      system but launching it twice.                          15:29:44

        17                While certainly not as inexpensive as         15:29:46

        18      abandoning the vision for space exploration and         15:29:49

        19      remaining in low Earth orbit for another                15:29:52

        20      30 years, it is significantly less expensive            15:29:54

        21      than the current plan.                                  15:29:59

        22                Because the Jupiter's main engines and        15:30:01

         1      solid rocket boosters already finished, our             15:30:05

         2      schedule and budget are not dictated by such            15:30:06

         3      costly and high schedule risk items.                    15:30:11

         4                By stretching out the remaining               15:30:13

         5      shuttle flights by one or two years, we can             15:30:16

         6      deliver a significantly smoother and, therefore,        15:30:18

         7      safer fly-out of the remaining shuttle missions         15:30:22

         8      by providing a future for the operations                15:30:26

         9      workforce.  We are depending on them right now          15:30:28

        10      to stay at their posts despite our lack of              15:30:30


        11      commitment to them.                                     15:30:36

        12                Direct can do this even in the tough          15:30:37

        13      budget environment before us, because the               15:30:41

        14      shuttle workforce in a Direct approach is an            15:30:42

        15      asset.  We need it in order to conduct the              15:30:45

        16      Jupiter test flights themselves and not a               15:30:49

        17      liability to be eliminated in order to fund the         15:30:52

        18      development costs of Ares.                              15:30:56

         1                Ultimately the transition will not be         15:31:09

         2      pain free, by any means.  America will have a           15:31:14

         3      much more capable system sooner than any other          15:31:17

         4      plan on the table at the end of that transition.        15:31:20

         5                A lot has been said about the                 15:31:23

         6      importance of crew safety during the ascent             15:31:28

         7      portion of the mission, yet ascent risk                 15:31:30

         8      represents a very small portion of the overall          15:31:35

         9      mission risk for beyond Earth orbit                     15:31:37

        10      destinations.  For these missions, it is, in            15:31:43

        11      fact, redundancy and margins of the crew                15:31:45

        14                Due, in part, to the Ares I's limited         15:31:53

        15      lift capability and unprecedented vibrational           15:31:55

        16      environment, Orion has been forced to remove            15:31:57

        17      important safety systems and reduce overall             15:32:00

        18      redundancy.  As a result, the overall crew              15:32:02

        19      safety has been significantly reduced during the        15:32:06

         2      largely composed of existing flight-proven              15:32:19

         3      systems, only casts further doubts on the Ares I        15:32:22

         4      safety claims.  Regardless, the Jupiter enables         15:32:27

         5      all of the safety systems that NASA originally          15:32:31

         6      wanted on Orion, not the least of which is              15:32:34

         7      returning to the land landing capability once           15:32:38

         8      again for every mission.                                15:32:41

         9                Even our entry level launch system,           15:32:44

        10      the Jupiter-130 -- that's the system without the        15:32:46

        11      upper stage -- will provide a remarkable range          15:32:46

        12      of new capabilities.                                    15:32:46

        13                For example, currently there is no way        15:32:54

        14      to repair or upgrade the James Webb Space               15:32:56

        15      Telescope.  With Direct, a servicing mission            15:33:00

        16      could be conducted using the Jupiter-130 to             15:33:02

        17      place both crew and equipment into a high Earth         15:33:07

        18      orbit, rendezvous the telescope and repair it in        15:33:09

        19      a similar fashion as what happened with Hubble,         15:33:15

        20      only in a much higher orbit.                            15:33:19

        21                The same capability could be used to          15:33:19

        22      assemble a network of extremely large 12-meter          15:33:19

         2      resolve other habitable planets in our galaxy,          15:33:24

         3      answering a question as old as mankind itself:          15:33:32

         4      Are we alone?                                           15:33:30

         5                The Jupiter's increased payload               15:33:35

         6      diameter enables robust Mars sample return              15:33:38

         7      missions that would pioneer new entry ascent            15:33:39

        10                On Earth everywhere we find an energy         15:33:47

        11      source and liquid water, we find life.  With our        15:33:51

        12      entry level Jupiter, we enable the Earth                15:33:55

        13      departure mass required for these kind of large         15:33:58

        14      missions to the Jovian moons in order to find if        15:33:59

        15      a second genesis has, indeed, occurred within           15:34:03

        16      our own solar system.                                   15:34:07

        17                By removing the barriers that limit           15:34:09

        18      all future exploration, the Jupiter will ensure         15:34:11

        19      that NASA and, therefore, mankind's best days of        15:34:15

        20      discovery clearly lie ahead.  As Carl Sagan once        15:34:19

        21      said, somewhere something incredible are waiting        15:34:24

        22      to be known.                                            15:34:28

         1                The Jupiter-130 will also enable new          15:34:28

         2      missions to the planet Earth, starting with an          15:34:29

         3      inspirational mission that originally went to           15:34:32

         4      explore the Moon, yet ended up rediscovering the        15:34:32

         5      Earth.  As a manmade spacecraft looked back at          15:34:38

         6      Earth in 1968, all of mankind became aware that         15:34:40

         7      we are all astronauts and drove home the                15:34:45

         8      importance of protecting our delicate spacecraft        15:34:50

        10                We are quickly approaching a time             15:34:53

        11      where the majority of people on Earth were not          15:34:56

        12      yet born to experience -- myself among them --          15:34:57

        13      this profound mission themselves.  It would find        15:35:00

        14      it just as remarkable as the previous generation        15:35:04

        15      did.                                                    15:35:08

        17      Jupiter-130 would be to launch space-based solar        15:35:11

         1      our galaxy could also improve the resolution of         15:35:30

         2      Earth's climate by many orders of magnitude.            15:35:33

         3      With this increased data resolution, climate            15:35:35

         4      models could be significantly improved in               15:35:39

         7                And, of course, there are national            15:35:47

         8      security reasons to improve our ability to look         15:35:49

         9      back at the Earth from space as well.                   15:35:52

        10                It has been asserted that any system          15:35:58

        11      based on the shuttle will be just as                    15:36:01

        12      unaffordable as the space shuttle.  Nothing             15:36:04

        13      could be further from the truth.  The cost              15:36:08

        14      breakout of the shuttle shown here is based on          15:36:11

        15      almost three decades of hard cost data generated        15:36:14

        16      by a mature system.                                     15:36:18

        17                Because the Jupiter is so closely             15:36:19

        18      associated with the shuttle, we can, with a high        15:36:21

        19      degree of confidence, predict what the cost             15:36:24

        20      structure will likely be for the Jupiter.               15:36:27

        21                Once the costs associated the orbiter         15:36:31

         1      cargo only launch of the Jupiter-130 would be           15:36:36

         2      about 72 percent of the current shuttle -- a            15:36:40

         3      step in the right direction certainly but not a         15:36:41

         4      large cost reduction.                                   15:36:44

         6      effectiveness in going from the shuttle to the          15:36:48


         7      Jupiter is not from the reduced cost but from           15:36:51

         8      the increased lift capacity.  By removing the           15:36:53

         9      dead weight of the orbiter, we can achieve              15:36:57

        10      almost a fivefold increase in lift capacity.            15:37:01

        11      Taken together, the Jupiter will deliver almost         15:37:06

        12      a sevenfold improvement in dollars per kilogram         15:37:08

        13      delivered to orbit compared to that of the              15:37:08

        14      shuttle, dropping it almost below $5,000 per            15:37:11

        15      kilogram to orbit, a very competitive price,            15:37:15

        16      indeed.  Next slide.                                    15:37:16

        17                The cost benefits of the Jupiter go           15:37:21

        18      well beyond launch costs.  The Saturn V was the         15:37:24

        19      first and last time America had access to a high        15:37:27

        20      volume, heavy-lift launch capacity.  With the           15:37:31

        21      Saturn V we were able to launch                         15:37:33

        22      ground-integrated, more capable spacecraft into         15:37:39

         1      space using only one launch.                            15:37:40

         2                After destroying our first heavy-lift         15:37:42

         3      launch system, we were then forced to assemble          15:37:45

         4      large spacecraft like the International Space           15:37:49

         5      Station in 20-ton chunks.  Mike Griffin had it          15:37:49

         6      right when he said this was a step backwards in         15:37:53

         7      terms of cost effectiveness.                            15:37:55

         8                Unmanned exploration experienced the          15:37:59

         9      same dynamic, with the development cost overruns        15:38:00

        11      Science Laboratory now running many times their         15:38:07

        12      respective launch cost due, in part, to trying          15:38:09

        13      to shoehorn more capability into existing launch        15:38:12

        14      systems' capacities.  It pays to use the right          15:38:17

        15      tool for the job.                                       15:38:20

        19      on record of claiming the Jupiter cannot achieve        15:38:35

        20      a self-imposed performance objective that NASA          15:38:38

        21      has seen fit to place ahead of the real of              15:38:45

         1                In fact, they took it one step further        15:38:48

         2      and claimed that Jupiter actually violated the          15:38:50

         3      laws of physics, yet the recently leaked ESAS           15:38:52

         4      appendix shows that a lower performing                  15:38:52

         5      configuration of the Jupiter will actually              15:38:59

         6      exceed NASA's self-imposed performance objective        15:39:00

         7      even while burdened by an inefficient upper             15:39:06

         8      stage design, a self-imposed performance                15:39:09

         9      objective that the technically challenged Ares I        15:39:12

        10      and the budget-busting Ares V can still cannot          15:39:13

        11      achieve.                                                15:39:16

        12                Not only does Direct meet NASA's              15:39:17

        13      desired lunar performance objectives but Direct         15:39:22

        14      will place NASA back within the confines of             15:39:23

        15      policy for a price we can actually afford.              15:39:26

        16                Based on this track record, we                15:39:29

        17      strongly recommend that this commission get a           15:39:31

         4      critical issues brought before the commission.          15:39:54

         5                What about the performance needed for         15:39:57

         6      Mars though?                                            15:39:59

         7                This issue was addressed over 46 years        15:40:01

         8      ago by none other than Werner Von Brown himself,        15:40:05

         9      who had always dreamed of one day seeing man            15:40:08

        10      land on Mars.  He said that once you reach the          15:40:11

        11      limit of whatever launch system you can forward         15:40:14

        12      you're left with two options for increasing             15:40:18

        13      performance.                                            15:40:21

        14                The first option is what he called            15:40:22

        15      connect mode, where you assemble various                15:40:22

        16      spacecraft elements in Earth orbit.  The second         15:40:26

        17      option, though, is called tanker mode, where the        15:40:29

        18      spacecraft is launched in one piece, dry, if            15:40:31

        19      necessary -- without propellant -- but then is          15:40:34

        20      filled in orbit with propellant prior to                15:40:37

        21      departure.                                              15:40:38

        22                Von Brown clearly preferred tanker            15:40:40


                                                              308



         1      mode because he correctly understood that most          15:40:42

         2      of the mass needed for Mars -- for a Mars               15:40:46

         3      mission is, in fact, propellant, not spacecraft.        15:40:49

         4      Therefore, propellant is the primary component          15:40:53

         5      that we need to assemble in orbit.                      15:40:56

         6                Well, the best way to assemble a              15:41:00

         7      propellant in orbit is with a propellant depot.         15:41:01

         8      A propellant depot has a number of advantages,          15:41:06

         9      not all of them technical, some geopolitical as         15:41:07

        10      well.                                                   15:41:11

        11                A propellant depot increases mission          15:41:13

        12      flexibility while opening up almost 70 percent          15:41:13

        13      of the mass required to commercial and                  15:41:14

        14      international supply.  In addition, one future          15:41:17


        15      option for potentially lowering the cost of             15:41:22

        16      space exploration is by producing propellant            15:41:25

        17      from the Moon, Mars or other suitable bodies            15:41:27

        18      throughout our solar system.                            15:41:30

        19                A critical first step, though, is the         15:41:32

        20      ability to store and transfer propellant in             15:41:34

        21      space.  The propellant depot is also a critical         15:41:37

        22      step for lowering exploration costs still               15:41:42


                                                              309



         1      further, by reusing the very expensive                  15:41:42

         2      spacecraft, thereby, eliminating the need to            15:41:45

         3      throw away these expensive systems after each           15:41:50

         4      mission.                                                15:41:52

         5                Utilities that propound people also           15:41:52

         6      naturally attract international participation           15:41:54

         7      and funding as it improves the capabilities of          15:41:56

         8      all partner nations.                                    15:42:00

         9                The bottom line, once your volume             15:42:02

        10      capacity is sufficient to launch                        15:42:05

        11      ground-integrated spacecraft as one unit,               15:42:08

        12      your launcher is large enough.                          15:42:09

        13                The Saturn class Jupiter is more than         15:42:12

        14      sufficient for the exploration program while            15:42:15

        15      also having a lower fixed and variable cost than        15:42:17

        16      the Nova class Ares V.                                  15:42:19

        17                On the other extreme are those that           15:42:23

        18      would advocate an exclusive ELV/COTS program,           15:42:28

        19      thereby resulting in the destruction of                 15:42:31

        20      America's second heavy-lift system and                  15:42:34

        21      workforce.  The Direct plan meets that team more        15:42:36

        22      than halfway by opening up 70 percent of the            15:42:39


                                                              310



         1      mass needed in orbit to competitive bid.                15:42:42

         2                In addition, a significant barrier to         15:42:46

         3      entry for new companies and approaches is               15:42:49

         4      removed because cheap propellant is less                15:42:52

         5      expensive to insure than expensive spacecraft or        15:42:56

         6      people.  Unlike opening up a few flights to the         15:42:58

         7      International Space Station per year, this              15:43:00

         8      approach represents more than enough demand to          15:43:01

         9      max out the launch capacity of most ELV/COTS            15:43:04

        10      providers, enabling them to achieve the                 15:43:09

        11      economies of production associated with high            15:43:13

        12      launch rates, lowering the costs for all their          15:43:13

        13      customers.                                              15:43:16

        14                Establishing an in-space market for           15:43:20

        15      propellant will also help build the business            15:43:20

        16      case to commercially develop propellant from the        15:43:22

        17      Moon as well.                                           15:43:26

        18                It has now been almost four years             15:43:28

        19      since the basics of what I just presented here          15:43:30

        20      was first shown at NASA headquarters but                15:43:32

        21      unfortunately rejected in favor of the Ares I.          15:43:34

        22                Even now because so much of the               15:43:37

         1      hardware infrastructure and workforce are still         15:43:39

         2      in place operating the shuttle, Direct can              15:43:42

         3      enable -- Direct can be available much sooner           15:43:44

         4      while also delivering a significant increase in         15:43:48

         5      crew safety over the shuttle.                           15:43:51

         6                Direct not only builds upon its               15:43:53

         7      existing multibillion-dollar heritage but               15:43:55

         8      simultaneously accelerates the progress already         15:43:59

         9      made by removing the bottleneck of the Ares I           15:44:00

        10      for ISS access and retargeting its development          15:44:04

        11      already underway for subsequent -- for the              15:44:08

        12      subsequent lunar phase of the vision for space          15:44:10


        13      exploration.                                            15:44:13

        14                Ultimately I strongly believe that            15:44:14

        15      Direct is the only way our nation can hope to           15:44:16

        16      achieve the policy objectives within the limited        15:44:20

        17      budget we have before us.                               15:44:20

        18                Direct not only solves the looming            15:44:22

        19      issues facing manned space exploration, which is        15:44:26

        20      the goal of this commission, but presents -- but        15:44:28

        21      will present a new opportunity for unmanned             15:44:33

        22      exploration as well by removing the limits              15:44:37


                                                              312



         1      imposed by existing launch systems.                     15:44:40

         2                The ability to lead from the front and        15:44:43

         3      capability will naturally attract other nations         15:44:46

         4      to join the American led efforts and to a truly         15:44:50

         5      global effort while at the same time providing a        15:44:53

         6      serious opportunity to the commercial sector to         15:44:57

         7      deliver most of the mass needed for the vision          15:45:00

         8      over the long term.                                     15:45:02

         9                Taken together, we strongly believe           15:45:02

        10      that Direct is by far the best possible path.           15:45:02

        11      It's an ultimate success for NASA, which is             15:45:06

        12      what's motivated from the Direct from the very          15:45:09

        13      beginning -- America, mankind and the furthering        15:45:12

        14      space exploration and development.                      15:45:17

        15                I carry three requests from the Direct        15:45:20

        16      team to the commission.                                 15:45:22

        17                The first request is the commission           15:45:24

        18      ask the President to order NASA to cease any            15:45:25

        19      further destruction of the shuttle                      15:45:26

        20      infrastructure until this commission can make           15:45:28

        21      its recommendation to the President.                    15:45:31

         1      commission endeavor to talk to the engineers at         15:45:36

         2      the working level of the Ares I technical               15:45:38

         4      anonymously as possible in order to determine           15:45:44

         5      independently for themselves the ground truth of        15:45:47

         6      the present program.                                    15:45:50

         7                We have certain knowledge that this           15:45:51

         8      ground truth is being altered as it ascends the         15:45:54

         9      chain of command, and there's significant amount        15:45:58

        10      of pressure being brought to bear to prevent any        15:46:01

        11      information from being provided to this                 15:46:04

        12      commission that is counter to the current party         15:46:06

        14                Our third request is for the                  15:46:09

        15      commission to get a second expert opinion on all        15:46:11

        16      critical issues or disagreements NASA may have          15:46:14

        17      with our plan -- like the upper stage, for              15:46:17

        18      example -- from sources independent of the              15:46:19

        19      current NASA chain of command.                          15:46:22

        20                I thank you for your time, and I              15:46:23

        21      welcome any questions you may have.                     15:46:25

         1      Those are very serious charges as well as a very        15:46:31

         2      serious set of performance and cost data you've         15:46:36

         3      offered us.                                             15:46:41

         4                Let me ask if my colleagues have any          15:46:42

         5      questions to begin with.  Then I have one.              15:46:45

         6                MR. CHYBA:  Steve, you may not be the         15:46:57

         7      right person to ask this, but in the ESAS study         15:46:57

         8      in '05 the sort of -- something that looked             15:46:58

         9      pretty close to this to launch a 70-ish-ton             15:46:59

        10      vehicle was pretty closely looked at and, in            15:47:02


        11      fact, carried as one of the options at least in         15:47:05

        12      the first and second cycle of the ESAS study.           15:47:06

        13                Do you understand what the rationale          15:47:10

        14      was in the ESAS study that caused the decision          15:47:15

        15      to be made into the so-called one-and-a-half            15:47:18

        16      launch options as opposed to the sort of two            15:47:22

        17      70-ton class launches, and what would your              15:47:28

        18      response be to that rationale?                          15:47:31

        19                MR. METSCHAN:  I probably can't               15:47:32

        20      explain it to you because I don't understand it         15:47:35

        21      myself.                                                 15:47:36

        22                I think it makes a lot of sense to            15:47:36


                                                              315



         1      develop -- we really only have the money to             15:47:37

         2      develop one launch system, and I think the              15:47:39

         3      efforts of SpaceX and the efforts with the EELVs        15:47:41

         4      and the COTS program are more than adequately           15:47:46

         5      covering that class of launch systems the Ares I        15:47:50

         6      represents.  I think NASA's right position is to        15:47:52

         7      work on a heavy launch system.                          15:47:56

         8                I would also suggest that the current         15:47:58

         9      Ares V has gone a great distance away from the          15:48:00

        10      Ares V that they recommended.  The Jupiter is           15:48:04

        11      closer to the original Ares V than the current          15:48:06

        12      one.  It used shuttle main engines.  We use             15:48:09

        13      four.  They used five.                                  15:48:11

        14                But so I'm -- again, our main                 15:48:14

        15      contention really is the Ares I, not the                15:48:17

        16      heavy-lift capability, and our only                     15:48:20

        17      recommendation is the heavy-lift capability             15:48:23

        18      needs to get back to a true shuttle-drive               15:48:25

        19      system.                                                 15:48:28

        20                MR. CHYBA:  Thank you.                        15:48:28


        21                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Jeff...                       15:48:34

        22                MR. GREASON:  I've got a thousand of          15:48:34


                                                              316



         1      them, not just one.  So I'll ask a meta question        15:48:32

         2      first.                                                  15:48:32

         3                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Just one.                     15:48:32

         4                MR. GREASON:  Just let me get back to         15:48:36

         5      you with more questions.                                15:48:37

         6                MR. METSCHAN:  Yes.  Definitely.              15:48:37

         7                MR. GREASON:  Okay.  In that case,            15:48:39

         8      I'll take only the highest one, which is, you           15:48:39

         9      know, I'm well aware of the many advantages that        15:48:43

        10      you get from propellant depot architecture, and         15:48:47

        11      I understand the concerns about the workforce           15:48:51

        12      but set that aside for a moment.                        15:48:52

        13                Now, if you are going to do a depot           15:48:57

        14      capability, why not go farther?  Because when           15:49:01

        15      you look at any of the systems architecture I'm         15:49:04

        16      familiar with, the spacecraft dry already fit on        15:49:07

        17      EELV-like objects.                                      15:49:11

        18                MR. METSCHAN:  They do mass-wise.             15:49:14

        19      They do not volume-wise.  People keep forgetting        15:49:17

        20      the importance of volume.  When I saw some of           15:49:17

        21      the Delta heavy configurations, they kept the           15:49:21

        22      same five-meter -- yeah -- if it's big sack of          15:49:26


                                                              317



         1      hammers we're putting up there, they're probably        15:49:26

         2      right.  But most -- the average density of              15:49:26

         3      payload in space is about that of balsa wood.           15:49:33

         4                So you've got to keep that in mind.           15:49:33

         5      You've got to grow your volume at the same time         15:49:36

         6      you're growing your lift capability, and the            15:49:38

         7      Jupiter does that.                                      15:49:41

         8                MR. GREASON:  Thank you.                      15:49:43


         9                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Please, Leroy...              15:49:43

        10                MR. CHIAO:  I just have a question            15:49:47

        11      about who are you guys.  I mean, is there a list        15:49:49

        12      of folks who are -- I mean, I understand what           15:49:52

        13      you're saying about wanting to be anonymous.            15:49:54

        14      But are any of you besides you willing to be            15:49:57

        15      identified?                                             15:50:00

        16                MR. METSCHAN:  Well, when you find            15:50:01

        17      them, let me know, because I don't know them all        15:50:02

        18      either.  In fact, none of us do.  It's -- we're         15:50:03

        19      taking advantage of the new communication               15:50:05

        20      technologies that came available with computers         15:50:08

        21      and the Internet.                                       15:50:11

        22                Which, I think, is why going forward          15:50:13


                                                              318



         1      after this point -- and we fully attend to abide        15:50:17

         2      by the recommendations of the commission.  This         15:50:21

         3      is not -- there's no way to make money at this,         15:50:23

         4      by the way, of disagreeing with your customer.          15:50:25

         5                MR. CHIAO:  It's just difficult to            15:50:30

         6      assess the work without knowing who's doing it.         15:50:31

         7                MR. METSCHAN:  Well, we can get you           15:50:34

         8      names of people to talk to, but the anonymous           15:50:35

         9      part is critical.  There's a certain amount of          15:50:37

        10      blood in the water, if you will.                        15:50:41

        11                So I just think it's -- it would be --        15:50:43

        12      if you want to get to the bottom of what's going        15:50:45

        13      on, I think that's the best policy.  I think            15:50:48

        14      that's the great thing about this commission            15:50:51

        15      actually.                                               15:50:53

        16                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Bo...                         15:50:55

        17                MR. BEJMUK:  Steve, I'm impressed with        15:50:55

        18      your enthusiasm and with your boldness, but I do        15:50:56


        19      have one question.                                      15:51:00

        20                And your charts are not numbered.  So         15:51:03

        21      this is a pie chart that talks about your               15:51:04

        22      Jupiter and STS cost comparison.                        15:51:08


                                                              319



         1                MR. METSCHAN:  Yes.                           15:51:08

         2                MR. BEJMUK:  Can we get that chart            15:51:14

         3      back for a second?                                      15:51:15

         4                (Discussion off the record.)                  15:51:15

         5                MR. BEJMUK:  Well, let me go ahead            15:51:22

         6      with my question.                                       15:51:23

         7                You're comparing current STS to your          15:51:24

         8      Jupiter-130 and you're saying that the cost of          15:51:29

         9      five flights, I believe, is $2.6 billion and you        15:51:34

        10      contrast it with only 1.9 billion for Jupiter.          15:51:40

        11                MR. METSCHAN:  Correct.                       15:51:45

        12                MR. BEJMUK:  But shouldn't you include        15:51:46

        13      cost of five Orions if you wanted to have like          15:51:49

        14      an apples-to-apples comparison?                         15:51:51

        15                MR. METSCHAN:  Well, this is cargo            15:51:53

        16      version.                                                15:51:53

        17                MR. BEJMUK:  Well, I know, but you're         15:51:54

        18      comparing it to a vehicle that carries seven            15:51:54

        19      astronauts also.                                        15:51:57

        20                MR. METSCHAN:  Actually that's one of         15:51:58

        21      the big advantages of this approach.  We can fly        15:51:59

        22      with a crew or not, and so we have both the             15:52:01


                                                              320



         1      cargo version and a crewed version.  Obviously          15:52:04

         2      if you fly with a crew, any launch system will          15:52:09

         3      be more expensive than if you don't fly with a          15:52:13

         4      crew.  That's one of the utilities of this              15:52:13

         5      approach.                                               15:52:17

         6                MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.  So this is a cargo        15=
:52:17

         7      version and you're --                                   15:52:18

         8                MR. METSCHAN:  Right.                         15:52:21

         9                MS. CLINE:  -- comparing it to a              15:52:19

        10      crew-fairing vehicle?                                   15:52:20

        11                MR. METSCHAN:  But that's the                 15:52:21

        12      interesting thing about the shuttle.  It                15:52:23

        13      combined cargo and crew together.                       15:52:24

        14                MR. BEJMUK:  Right.                           15:52:24

        15                MR. METSCHAN:  Which not only affected        15:52:27

        16      the safety and the abort possibilities --               15:52:28

        17      because our cargo is carried below the crew if          15:52:29

        18      the crew -- if the crew comes along with the            15:52:29

        19      mission equipment, they're carried below it like        15:52:33

        20      Apollo, so they're unaffected by their abort.           15:52:35

        21                So we believe that was the fundamental        15:52:39

        22      recommendation from the Columbia report.  Let's         15:52:41


                                                              321



         1      not have such a large launch system that we             15:52:43

         2      can't quickly and safely extract the crew should        15:52:48

         3      something go wrong.                                     15:52:51

         4                Likewise, it works on a cost basis            15:52:51

         5      which means now you can have a cargo version            15:52:53

         6      that's less expensive and also fly crew when you        15:52:54

         7      need to as well.                                        15:52:57

         8                MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.  Thank you.                15:52:57

         9                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Chris...                      15:53:01

        10                MR. CHYBA:  You stated that the               15:53:01

        11      Jupiter system would represent an improvement in        15:53:04

        12      crew safety compared to the shuttle.                    15:53:04

        13                Could you quantify that?                      15:53:06

        14                MR. METSCHAN:  Well, right away if you        15:53:09

        15      assume we had the same safety level as the              15:53:11

        16      shuttle, the two accidents that we know of --           15:53:13


        17      the Challenger, being the SRB leaking, could            15:53:16

        18      have been abortable had we been watching for            15:53:23

        19      those kinds of things, the leaking SRB.  And            15:53:24

        20      then, of course, in the Columbia accident, the          15:53:28

        21      heat shield is entirely protected during the            15:53:29

        22      ascent.                                                 15:53:32


                                                              322



         1                So just having a quick escape system          15:53:34

         2      on the shuttle, which we currently really do not        15:53:37

         3      have, and assuming that's one out of ten -- you         15:53:39

         4      know, it fails out of ten times, you get a              15:53:42

         5      tenfold improvement.                                    15:53:44

         6                Now, I'm glad you brought that up             15:53:45

         7      because there's another big advantage.  In our          15:53:45

         8      architecture, even in a lunar program, half of          15:53:48

         9      the time we're launching uncrewed.  So as long          15:53:50

        10      as the vehicle is being processed and treated as        15:53:55

        11      if we have a crew on it, the probability of an          15:53:57

        12      accident occurring on a crewed flight is                15:54:00

        13      naturally cut in half.                                  15:54:02

        14                That's one of the advantages that the         15:54:04

        15      ELV and the other programs have is that they're         15:54:06

        16      essentially continually testing the entire              15:54:09

        17      system, which is not just hardware -- it's              15:54:10

        18      people, the culture.  Every time they launch,           15:54:10

        19      they're testing everything.                             15:54:14

        20                Many times these hardware safety-based        15:54:16

        21      assessments, I think, are incorrect.  When we           15:54:19

        22      looked at the accidents that have happened,             15:54:22


                                                              323



         1      they've been an impact -- they're interacted            15:54:25

         2      with the hardware, certainly, but there's a             15:54:26

         3      certain aspect of culture that came into it.            15:54:29


         4                MR. AUGUSTINE:  I'll take the last            15:54:32

         5      question, I think, if that's all right, with the        15:54:34

         6      group.                                                  15:54:36

         7                Many years ago NASA looked at a               15:54:37

         8      configuration quite similar to the Jupiter-130          15:54:39

         9      that -- based on the external tank, solid rocket        15:54:43

        10      motors and so on -- and didn't continue it.             15:54:47

        11                With your folks' apparent background          15:54:50

        12      and knowledge of NASA, do you have any idea why         15:54:52

        13      that was dropped?                                       15:54:55

        14                MR. METSCHAN:  I think they didn't            15:54:56

        15      want to operate both -- they didn't have the            15:54:58

        16      money to operate both the shuttle and that              15:54:58

        17      system at the same time.  I think now that the          15:55:01

        18      retirement of the shuttle is now official               15:55:04

        19      national policy we can now afford to                    15:55:05

        20      entertain -- it keeps coming back to the same           15:55:06

        21      principle.  I think we only have the money to           15:55:08

        22      operate one launch system.  So let's make it as         15:55:10


                                                              324



         1      capable and as expandable as we can.  And I             15:55:13

         2      think the in-line version of a shuttle-drive            15:55:15

         3      system achieves that objective.                         15:55:18

         4                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, thank you very          15:55:20

         5      much for your presentation.  We will take it            15:55:22

         6      very seriously.                                         15:55:25

         7                Let's turn then to the final scheduled        15:55:27

         8      speaker for the day, and we're going to hear            15:55:33

         9      about side-mount options from John Shannon.             15:55:36

        10                MR. SHANNON:  You guys didn't tell me         15:55:47

        11      there was blood in the water before I                   15:55:49

        12      volunteered to do this.

        13                And just as a senior NASA manager, let

        14      me say, I don't agree with that, and I felt

        15      perfectly comfortable coming up here and talking


        16      about an alternate architecture, something that

        17      we've looked at for many years.  And, you know,

        18      Jeff and Steve Cook and company have embraced,

        19      and we've talked about it.  We talk about

        20      transition between programs all of the time.

        21                Sir, if you're worried about going to

        22      talk to anybody, come talk to me.  Talk to Wayne


                                                              325



         1      Hale.  Talk to Mike Suffredini.  Talk to -- just

         2      come talk to us, and we'll -- you know, if you

         3      don't want us to attribute things to you, we can

         4      certainly do that, but we're always looking for

         5      good ideas.

         6                And I think just the fact that I'm

         7      standing up here talking about something that

         8      departs from the current baseline should maybe

         9      prove that to you.

        10                Stay on the title page for a minute.

        11                I want to preface the presentation            15:56:45

        12      with some other comments here that NASA has a           15:56:48

        13      plan -- NASA has a baseline plan, and I think it        15:56:52

        14      was a well-thought-out plan in the time of ESAS         15:56:57

        15      and in that the Constellation program has put           15:57:00

        16      together a viable architecture.  And I'm not            15:57:05

        17      going to talk about an architecture.  I'm just          15:57:09

        18      going to talk about a launch vehicle.                   15:57:10

        19                But it has not been funded.  It has           15:57:12

        20      not been funded to the level that we would need         15:57:15

        21      to see it through.  And I see that on the               15:57:17

        22      shuttle side from the transition.                       15:57:19


                                                              326



         1                Jeff Hanley and myself worked with our        15:57:22

         2      teams.  We had a very close-knit transition             15:57:25

         3      plan, not just for civil servants but also for          15:57:27

         4      contractors.  And because of the funding                15:57:29

         5      problems, that has become un-knit, and we have          15:57:32

         6      gaps in the industrial capability and in the            15:57:36

         7      workforce, which is causing all of this.                15:57:38

         8                I don't think it is some big                  15:57:41

         9      conspiracy.  I don't think they've had cost             15:57:43

        10      overruns.  I think they've just not been funded         15:57:44

        11      the way that they were -- the plan was                  15:57:47

        12      originally produced.                                    15:57:48

        13                You know, we talked about this a              15:57:49

        14      couple of weeks ago, and I think that the first         15:57:50

        15      option should be to fund the plan that we have.         15:57:54

        16      But if we can't do that, I don't think we're            15:57:57

        17      ready to cede human space flight, like Elon             15:58:00

        18      said.  We're not ready to cede support of the           15:58:05

        19      ISS.  We're not ready to cede the opportunity to        15:58:06

        20      go outside of low Earth orbit.                          15:58:10

        21                So I've had a small team inside the           15:58:10

        22      shuttle program that has kept alive some of the         15:58:12


                                                              327



         1      side-mount decisions, and when I say small, it          15:58:13


         2      is three people that go and grab some                   15:58:16

         3      information from other people to think about new        15:58:19

         4      things.  And I'm going to talk a little bit             15:58:21

         5      about that.                                             15:58:24

         6                But you need to realize it has been a         15:58:25

         7      small effort.  It has not been across NASA.  It         15:58:27

         8      has not had the advantage of being looked at            15:58:31

         9      across the Agency -- for good reason.  It's             15:58:35

        10      because we have another plan, and it's just now         15:58:37

        11      that we're looking at and seeing the budget does        15:58:41

        12      not quite align with it.                                15:58:44

        13                So what I'm going to tell you today --        15:58:46

        14      is promising that it has some benefit, some             15:58:48

        15      things that could -- that are obvious advantages        15:58:49

        16      but it needs to be looked at to a much greater          15:58:51

        17      level than what my team has been able to do.            15:58:55

        18                Now, I want to -- we're still on the          15:58:58

        19      title page and I've burned like four minutes.           15:58:59

        20                This does not look at Shuttle C.  I           15:59:03

        21      don't even call it Shuttle C.  We call it a             15:59:05

        22      heavy-lift vehicle.  Shuttle C was an autonomous        15:59:07


                                                              328



         1      vehicle that separated from the external tank           15:59:12

         2      just like the orbiters had orbital maneuvering          15:59:12

         3      capability added to capability -- thermal               15:59:16

         4      capability -- a lot of different things that            15:59:17

         5      this does not have.                                     15:59:19

         6                This is simply a first and second             15:59:20

         7      stage to inject the payload into a

         8      30-nautical-mile by 120-nautical mile orbit.

         9      That payload is assumed to be autonomous.  It

        10      takes care of itself.  When it's injected, it

        11      goes off and does its thing.

        12                And all that you see in the title page

        13      picture goes into the ocean.  So it's just a --

        14      it's a foundational kind of a launch capability.


        15      Let's go to the next chart.

        16                We've looked at this a lot.  It's been

        17      called a lot of different things.  You can see

        18      what I was talking about on the upper left.  It

        19      was looked at by industry five years ago.  It

        20      was a two-year study.  So there is a lot of data

        21      out there.  I know we've provided a lot of that

        22      to you.


                                                              329



         1                We do not have a deployable fairing.

         2      When you get out of the atmosphere -- and this          16:00:03

         3      team I have, added that, which will give you a          16:00:04

         4      little bit more performance.  It also -- the            16:00:06

         5      beauty of, I think, the most recent concept the         16:00:10

         6      team has come up with is that it does not try to        16:00:14

         7      reuse engines.                                          16:00:19

         8                We have learned from life-cycle costs         16:00:20

         9      on SSMEs that you never -- reusability is a             16:00:22

        10      myth, in my opinion.  You don't buy your engines        16:00:27

        11      and then you never have to talk to the engine           16:00:29

        12      manufacturer again, you just keeping using them.        16:00:32

        13      That's not true at all -- because parts wear            16:00:35

        14      out, you have failures, you have design issues.         16:00:38

        15                So you have to keep your production           16:00:41

        16      line going or at least available to you, and            16:00:43

        17      that's a significant cost.  And then you buy            16:00:46

        18      "one of" pieces whenever you need new parts, and        16:00:47

        19      that gets to be extremely expensive.                    16:00:51

        20                So we would take, I think, the                16:00:53

        21      approach of you get rid of the very -- I'll say         16:00:55

        22      hazardous -- it's probably the most hazardous           16:01:00


                                                              330



         1      part, I think, on the orbiter -- of that                16:01:05

         2      interface between the main engines and the              16:01:06

         3      external tank and you just have straight pipes.         16:01:08

         4      You don't have all of your disconnects and your         16:01:10


         5      pyro systems and all of those things.  Let's go         16:01:10

         6      to the next chart.                                      16:01:14

         7                So that chart was just supposed to say        16:01:16

         8      we've looked at this many times over many years,        16:01:18

         9      and I think most of the people in this room are         16:01:20

        10      familiar with a lot of that.                            16:01:22

        11                This is just a basic cargo                    16:01:24

        12      configuration.  If you notice, it doesn't modify        16:01:27

        13      the external tank at all.  It's exactly -- the          16:01:30

        14      external tank we produce right now.  It's the           16:01:32

        15      solid rocket boosters we produce right now.  The        16:01:34

        16      boat tail that holds the SSMEs that are                 16:01:37

        17      unchanged is simplified because it is bolted            16:01:40

        18      directly onto the external tank.                        16:01:40

        19                It does not have the separation plane         16:01:40

        20      which causes a complexity.  An avionics module          16:01:44

        21      in front of it -- I'll talk about avionics in a         16:01:48

        22      minute -- and then a separable fairing that             16:01:53


                                                              331



         1      provides a performance boost up to about                16:01:55

         2      72-metric tons to that 30-by-120 orbit.  Next           16:01:56

         3      chart.                                                  16:02:03

         4                This is an important chart here.  What        16:02:03

         5      I would -- let me back up for a second here.            16:02:06

         6                I think Elon Musk hit it exactly              16:02:11

         7      right.  The way the Russians do things is really        16:02:14

         8      smart.  I wish we would have done Shuttle C in          16:02:18

         9      the '80s or the '90s.  I think the space shuttle        16:02:22

        10      orbiter would be a safer vehicle to fly if we           16:02:22

        11      had done Shuttle C back then.                           16:02:27

        12                Because if you have a cargo vehicle           16:02:29

        13      that is the same configuration as your crewed           16:02:32

        14      vehicle, you have the opportunity to roll in new        16:02:35

        15      design, new enhancements on the cargo vehicle           16:02:39

        16      much easier than you do on your manned vehicle.         16:02:44

        17                And that's what the Russians do.  For         16:02:44

        18      the most part, they'll fly new hardware on their        16:02:46

        19      Progress several times before they roll it into         16:02:48

        20      the Soyuz.                                              16:02:51

        21                And we have a terrible track record in        16:02:53

        22      the space shuttle program from upgrades.  We did        16:02:53


                                                              332



         1      main engine upgrades, controller upgrades, some         16:02:57

         2      things like that.  It costs us way too much             16:02:58

         3      money.  It took way too much time.  I think that        16:03:01

         4      is because you do not have a combined                   16:03:03

         5      environments test capability except to go fly           16:03:06

         6      the vehicle with a crew on it.  So that made it         16:03:09

         7      very difficult.                                         16:03:13

         8                I think if we had done Shuttle C we           16:03:15


         9      would have been able to roll in those upgrades          16:03:17

        10      on the cargo vehicle and verified through

        11      combined environment flight testing they

        12      actually are effective and then you can roll

        13      them into the crewed vehicle.  And I'm just

        14      guessing, but I think that our upgrades program

        15      would have been much more successful from that

        16      standpoint.

        17                So the thought here was that you build

        18      this Block I, which is just a two-stage

        19      capability to get to low Earth orbit.  As I said

        20      before, no change to the external tank.  No

        21      change to the SRBs.  No change to the SSMEs.

        22      You use existing avionics.


                                                              333



         1                And I grew up in the guidance,

         2      navigation and control world, and that is

         3      absolutely possible.

         4                The one thing that nobody has talked

         5      about in all of the rocket designs that we've

         6      seen that is an enormous bullet -- and those of

         7      you that have been -- that have ever worked with

         8      rockets or even -- or modern aircraft -- is             16:04:10

         9      flight software.  It is -- it will eat your             16:04:10

        10      lunch.  It is critical path from the day you put        16:04:12

        11      the first rocket drawing down a paper.                  16:04:15

        12                And getting flight software to work           16:04:18

        13      with your hardware from a timing standpoint is          16:04:21

        14      extremely difficult.  We've been flying the             16:04:24

        15      space shuttle for 30 years, and we'll still find        16:04:27

        16      things through simulation that we did not expect        16:04:27

        17      in the way software interacts with hardware.            16:04:29

        18                This Block I capability, you can use          16:04:31

        19      your existing flight software.  You can use the         16:04:33

        20      computers that we have right now.  You can use          16:04:36

        21      the rate gyros, the IMUs, the accelerometer             16:04:37

        22      assemblies -- all of those things required to           16:04:42


                                                              334



         1      fly any spacecraft but you've already got               16:04:45

         2      30 years of flight test behind it and use it.           16:04:48


         3                Now, I would not use the full suite           16:04:48

         4      that we use.  On an orbiter you can use one of          16:04:51

         5      each, and it would be perfectly safe.  The              16:04:53

         6      flight software can be modified just to no-op           16:04:56

         7      the channels that you're not flying on that             16:04:59

         8      particular spacecraft.                                  16:05:03

         9                The other one that nobody has talked          16:05:05

        10      about that we spent a lot of time and money on          16:05:07

        11      is your systems integration tools.  The acoustic        16:05:08

        12      models, your aerodynamic models, structural             16:05:13

        13      models, loads, your trajectory models --                16:05:19

        14      extremely important.                                    16:05:19

        15                As you all know -- and Bo actually            16:05:23

        16      wrote a paper on it not too long ago -- we              16:05:24

        17      totally blew the acoustics for STS-1 and almost         16:05:29

        18      lost the vehicle.  We had a structural member           16:05:34

        19      buckle in the OMS pod just because we did not           16:05:35

        20      have the water flow and the acoustics right.            12:00:38

        21                So if you use a more evolutionary             12:06:59

        22      approach that has the same or similar mold line         12:07:07


                                                              335



         1      of the space shuttle stack now -- you already           12:07:18

         2      have that history -- and you can roll it into           12:07:27

         3      your next vehicle and that's a big deal.                12:07:34

         4                Those are two things, I think, one,           12:08:16

         5      software and your environmental tools that              12:08:27

         6      people really overlook when they're starting to         12:08:35

         7      design a vehicle and don't understand very well.        12:08:54

         8                Existing pad structure, that follows.         12:09:13

         9                The launch and ground control                 12:09:24

        10      software, that's important because that --              12:09:54

        11      again, it's software and it will eat your lunch         12:10:01

        12      if you don't get it right.                              12:10:07


        13                That high-risk aft interface, it's            12:10:15

        14      just bolted on, so you got rid of that.                 12:10:31

        15                You don't have fuel cells, you'd have         12:10:42

        16      batteries, you don't have the cryo systems              12:10:50

        17      because you don't have fuel cells or people on          12:10:58

        18      it.  Nitrogen tanks, the cooling systems, your          12:11:04

        19      orbital maneuvering system, your RC -- you don't        12:11:36

        20      have any hypergols on it at all.  So it's a very        12:11:49

        21      slim-down and stream-lined kind of vehicle.             12:12:13

        22                And that's all very different from the        12:12:48

         1      Shuttle C.                                              12:12:53

         2                Block II, of course, you can do things        12:12:56

         3      to get more performance.  And at some point we          12:13:37

         4      will run out of spares in hardware that is              12:13:47

         5      cannibalized from orbital vehicles, and you             12:14:03

         6      would end up building.  But the nice thing is           12:14:19

         7      you're doing flight tests with your basic design        12:14:30

         8      as you're beginning to procure your follow-on           12:14:37

         9      avionics.  Next chart.                                  12:14:52

        10                I already talked about                        12:15:50

        11      infrastructure/facilities.  Y'all know how we do        12:16:05

        12      space shuttle.  You can obviously see that              12:16:12

        13      that -- you don't have to buy a new ET barge.           12:16:19

        14      Nobody has talked about that.  You know, you            12:17:02

        15      don't have to buy a new Pegasus.  You don't have        12:17:05

        16      to do solid rocket booster or anything like that        12:17:15

        17      that changes.                                           12:17:28

        18                And my complete ineptness at                  12:17:52

        19      PowerPoint means that the cargo carrier is              12:18:04

        20      really fat there.  I just noticed that.  But I          12:18:26

        21      just stretched the picture out, and that's why          12:18:35

        22      it looks like that.  Next chart.  Don't laugh.          12:18:42


                                                              337



         1      The last one great graphics.  That was good.            12:19:30

         2                The team has looked at payload                12:19:39

         3      envelopes and designs, and actually I think we          12:20:04

         4      found from the industry study that we would have        12:20:12

         5      a CG problem, and the center main engine would          12:20:16

         6      hit its gimbal limits.  So we actually shrunk           12:20:39

         7      the payload envelope a little bit.                      12:21:02

         8                They've done some studies -- again,           12:21:12

         9      this is something that needs a great deal of            12:21:17

        10      work from the broader community -- from the NASA        12:21:23

        11      team, from the Aerospace -- to show.  It does           12:21:30

        12      look like, you know, with the 72-metric tons            12:22:53

        13      that you could do quite a bit with that payload         12:23:04

        14      capacity.  Next chart.                                  12:23:33

        15                Everyone had one incomprehensible             12:23:40

        16      chart.  So this is mine.  And it is just the --         12:23:53


        17      it is just the flow of avionics and hardware            12:25:11

        18      required between Block I and then a follow-on           12:25:23

        19      Block I that has some new stuff and then a              12:25:57

        20      Block II, where you get all of the new stuff.           12:26:05

        21                And basically if you look across the          12:26:37

        22      top, there's no really new builds for avionics          12:26:41


                                                              338



         1      in the Block I architecture.  We could build it         12:26:51

         2      with the hardware we have in hand right now.            12:27:07

         3      Next chart.                                             12:28:34

         4                This is, to me, sort of like everybody        12:28:38

         5      comes, ah, Shuttle C is great but you've got to         12:30:02

         6      throw your SSMEs away and that makes it                 12:30:21

         7      unsustainable and it's unaffordable and let's           12:30:51

         8      move on to the next vehicle.                            12:31:12

         9                SSME, we have a million seconds of            12:33:05

        10      runtime on.  We understand SSME performance very        12:33:14

        11      well.  I have 14 assets right now limited by            12:33:54

        12      nozzles that you could go fly in a test program.        12:34:25

        13      We have all of the hardware.  We're set up to do        12:34:35

        14      the test.                                               12:34:41

        15                There is -- Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne        12:34:45

        16      can provide you books of data on the RS-25E,            12:35:53

        17      which is expendable, which is your channel wall         12:36:11

        18      nozzle, the non-refurbished turbo pumps.  The           12:36:22

        19      fact that you're not trying to refly these              12:36:34

        20      engines means you don't have inspection ports           12:36:40

        21      and you don't have a lot of different                   12:36:46

        22      requirements that you would -- that we have             12:36:52


                                                              339



         1      built into the SSME that has caused the cost to         12:36:57

         2      be significant.                                         12:37:08

         3                And you can't really take an SSME cost        12:37:10

         4      and say, well, that's what the expendable cost          12:37:23


         5      would be.  Because what you do for expendables          12:37:28

         6      is you put them on a production line and you            12:37:36

         7      would commoditize it basically.  And that's             12:37:47

         8      how -- you would build a certain number per             12:38:24

         9      year, and then you'd have the economy of scale          12:38:33

        10      to do that.                                             12:38:39

        11                So there is a lot of -- a lot of data         12:38:42

        12      on there in bullet PWR.  Go get it if you guys          12:38:48

        13      want.  Next chart.                                      12:39:04

        14                I really debated cost -- putting cost         12:39:23

        15      estimates in here.  The team needs to validate          12:39:51

        16      these.  I wasn't going to put them in because I         12:40:00

        17      said, well, you guys haven't spent enough time          12:40:08

        18      on this.  Then I looked at the industry study           12:40:14

        19      that was done in '04, '05.  The costs were              12:40:20

        20      almost exactly the same.                                12:40:38

        21                I put them in here for your interest.         12:40:41

        22      Take your big grain of salt right now.  And we          12:40:46


                                                              340



         1      need to go validate these numbers externally.           12:40:54

         2      Next chart.                                             12:41:08

         3                Everything I just said about cost I'll        12:41:10

         4      say about schedule.  The industry team and the          12:41:35

         5      NASA team, somewhat independently, came up with,        12:41:41

         6      if you turn it on, it's a 4-1/2-year project to         12:41:51

         7      fly your first test flight.  We need to work on         12:42:12

         8      this some more and debate it and get a better           12:42:22

         9      schedule.  So take your second big grain of salt        12:42:33

        10      now.  Next chart.                                       12:42:45

        11                We did some design reference mission          12:42:50

        12      just to show is this even something that would          12:43:37

        13      be useful.  It is obviously.  It's 70-plus              12:43:43

        14      metric tons, a heavy-lifter, that is -- there is        12:43:59


        15      not another vehicle right now other than the            12:44:15

        16      space shuttle that provides that kind of                12:44:23

        17      injection capability.  But would it be useful.          12:44:27

        18                And this gets a little bit into               12:44:48

        19      architecture, and I don't want to get into              12:44:59

        20      architecture.  I just want to talk to you about         12:45:24

        21      the launch vehicle.                                     12:45:30

        22                But these are some of the -- some of          12:45:34


                                                              341



         1      the ideas the team has thrown out.  And, again,         12:45:39

         2      I would say that this needs a lot of work with          12:45:51

         3      the broader community.  Next chart.                     12:45:57

         4                The thought being this is -- you can          12:46:01

         5      kind of see the approach, normal solid rocket           16:11:19

         6      booster separation, fairing separation, you hit         16:11:23

         7      MECO and off goes your upper stage with                 16:11:25

         8      autonomous rendezvous and docking capability --         16:11:29

         9      which actually if we would have launched this           16:11:32

        10      morning, we were going to demonstrate the               16:11:34

        11      autonomous rendezvous and docking capability.           16:11:36

        12                We put some sensors on in the payload         16:11:39

        13      bay of Endeavour and we'll demonstrate that             16:11:42

        14      software and I hope -- although doing it within         16:11:46

        15      eight flights is going to be difficult.  I hope         16:11:48

        16      to have the capability to demonstrate the               16:11:53

        17      shuttle autonomous docking to the ISS.  At least        16:11:55

        18      we'll get the sensor data and then put it on the        16:11:56

        19      ground through simulation and be able to show           16:11:59

        20      that.                                                   16:12:02

        21                And then you toss your external tank          16:12:03

        22      with the big heel structure that goes up to the         16:12:05


                                                              342

         4      looks like, and obviously you phase with                16:12:14

         5      station.  Next chart.                                   16:12:33

         6                We have looked at crewed options.             16:12:33

         7      This was the ISS crew piece.  We have done some

         8      early assessments on the launch abort system,

         9      being close to the inner tank, and it looks

        10      doable.  Again, this is a prime area of heavy

        11      study to look at the LAS.  You'll see a chart

        12      where it shows safety.  It all depends on how

        13      effective we can make a launch abort system

        14      work.

        15                The thought here would be that you

        16      would end up injecting the carrier with an MPLM

        17      or external payloads, and you would fly it

        18      actually around and dock with it and then fly it

        19      to the station.  Next chart.

        20                This is the crew and logistics launch

        21      just like before.  Next chart.

        22                There was also a profile where you            16:13:06


                                                              343



         1      could do a two launch, one from Pad A, one from         16:13:08

         2      Pad B.  You may have noticed before Hubble we           16:13:11

         3      had a shuttle sitting out at each of the two            16:13:13

         4      pads.  So from a ground-up standpoint, that was         16:13:15

         5      maybe a precursor look at how you could do that.        16:13:19

         6                Lunar lander with an Earth departure          16:13:21

         7      stage on it.                                            16:13:25

         8                And then fly Orion.  Same discussion          16:13:26

         9      we had on LAS with its Earth departure stage.           16:13:30

        10      Next chart.                                             16:13:30

        11                And, again, we're into architecture.          16:13:33

        12      What I would do is, as opposed to training two          16:13:33

        13      EDSs with a lander and a CV, I would go and put         16:13:37

        14      my -- put the lunar lander in lunar orbit, and          16:13:40

        15      then if it has hypergols on it, you can go              16:13:45

        16      whenever you want, you can launch your crewed           16:13:50

        17      vehicle.                                                16:13:53


        18                I'll say right -- this is not the             16:13:53

        19      lunar lander that is currently in the baseline          16:13:57

        20      architecture.  This is a different lunar lander.        16:14:01

        21      The guys just were running some calculations.           16:14:04

        22      It was a 28-metric ton lander.                          16:14:04


                                                              344



         1                Doug, what's the -- Altair right now          16:14:08

         2      is 45-ish.  Apollo was 16-ish.  So it's a               16:14:12

         3      different architecture, and that's something you        16:14:17

         4      have to understand right off.  It's not as              16:14:19

         5      capable as what the Ares V architecture looks           16:14:21

         6      like.                                                   16:14:25

         7                You know, we can talk the same depot          16:14:25

         8      discussion.  I like depots, but there's --              16:14:30

         9      again, they're different architectures than what        16:14:30

        10      we have right now, and this has not received            16:14:32

        11      sufficient study time from the broader community        16:14:35

        12      to say this is the answer in any -- in any way          16:14:39

        13      at all.  Next chart.                                    16:14:42

        14                Well, okay.  I've got two                     16:14:42

        15      incomprehensible charts.  This is a baseball            16:14:42

        16      card of just performance between the cargo              16:14:42

        17      version for Block I and Block II and then the           16:14:42

        18      crewed version.  Next chart.                            16:14:42

        19                This is -- I'm not going to spend a           16:14:58

        20      lot of time on this.  We are flying at the max          16:15:00

        21      rate on the shuttle program in fiscal year 10.          16:15:03

        22      If we were going to move into something like            16:15:08


                                                              345



         1      this, I would lobby strongly to spread out the          16:15:09

         2      fiscal year 10 launches into 11 and in 12 and as        16:15:09

         3      we restarted production for solid rocket                16:15:16

         4      boosters and external tanks.                            16:15:19


         5                And the configuration is so similar,          16:15:21

         6      you know, production is really what you have to         16:15:24

         7      worry about, and you could essentially get rid          16:15:26

         8      of most of the gap by doing that.  Now, you will        16:15:30

         9      have a gap because Orion -- the Orion                   16:15:33

        10      development time is what would pace the next            16:15:35

        11      crewed vehicle.  Next chart.                            16:15:39

        12                There are some growth options from the        16:15:40

        13      81 tons.  I didn't just magically go from 72 to         16:15:42

        14      81.  It's a suborbital staging.  You load up the        16:15:45

        15      vehicle more, you end up with MECO that is a            16:15:50

        16      suborbital, but then you separate your third            16:15:51

        17      stage with either J-2 or an SSME and off you go.        16:15:55

        18      You get to 81 tons by doing that suborbital             16:15:55

        19      staging.  If you ran your SSMEs at                      16:16:00

        20      109 percent -- and I wouldn't let you do that           16:16:03

        21      with crew on it, but with cargo on it, you might        16:16:05

        22      want to do it.                                          16:16:08


                                                              346



         1                Five-segment SRBs we've talked about

         2      before.  If you had an SSME on your Earth

         3      departure stage -- there's a few things you

         4      could do to maybe get above 90-metric tons.

         5      There are some -- these things are lines on a

         6      chart, but there would be great expense and a

         7      significant amount of development testing

         8      required before you would sign up to do any of

         9      these.                                                  16:16:09

        10                So I wouldn't say, hey, this idea will        16:16:09

        11      get you above 90-metric tons.  It's -- those are        16:16:09

        12      thoughts.  Next chart.                                  16:16:32

        13                I asked my guys to go off and say,            16:16:32

        14      hey, let's just do a PRA.  We know what all of          16:16:35

        15      the different pieces are -- all of the different        16:16:40

        16      components are, except I don't know the EDS or I        16:16:40

        17      don't know what -- what's under the fairing, but        16:16:42


        18      for the stuff that you see in the little picture        16:16:44

        19      on the lower right, where would you get -- and          16:16:47

        20      we did a 5 percent/95 percent study, and you can        16:16:48

        21      see the numbers for the loss of vehicle that we         16:16:52

        22      got.  Again, this is your third big grain of            16:16:55


                                                              347



         1      salt here.  Next chart.                                 16:16:59

         2                Boy, this just makes sense, right, is         16:17:00

         3      that -- if your launch abort system is                  16:17:05

         4      100 percent successful, you're flying a pretty          16:17:07

         5      safe rocket.  It will not be.  And it actually          16:17:12

         6      may be low if we look at the shock interactions         16:17:15

         7      between the LAS and the external tank.                  16:17:19

         8                This is an area that needs a                  16:17:22

         9      significant amount of study.  And I think if we         16:17:24

        10      were at all serious about doing something like          16:17:29

        11      this we would go work on that as a -- as the            16:17:31

        12      first thing we would go do.  Next chart.                16:17:32

        13                Sep design.  I told them I didn't want        16:17:34

        14      any RCS, I didn't want any extra propulsion.  So

        15      post MECO, of course, your fairing is gone, and

        16      it's -- they designed -- some of the guys at

        17      JSC -- a spring mechanism that just pops it out,

        18      and you would add the ET tumble valve back on to

        19      give you a good clean separation.  We think this

        20      is a very solvable problem.  Next chart.

        21                Yeah.  We did a little thing there.

        22      Next chart.

         1                The first bullet is the most important

         2      bullet.  The HLV design, it is less capable than

         3      the current baseline.  And we need to stress

         4      that fact.

         5                And it has not been studied to the

         6      amount where I feel very comfortable coming up

         7      here and telling you a whole lot about it.  I

         8      think it is something that if we decided we were

         9      not going to get the money to do the baseline

        10      plan and we wanted a backup that would provide a


        11      lunar capability or a human servicing of the

        12      station capability that this is something that

        13      we would want to go study again.

        14                And, again, we've spent 30 years

        15      studying it.  So we have a lot of background to

        16      do that.

        17                Benefits are obvious.  We basically           16:18:30

        18      have the parts to build everything.  What we

        19      don't have is some structural parts for the keel

        20      for the fairing and for the boat tail to mount

        21      up the engines.  If you're going to have a

        22      development or a program, I think the structural


                                                              349



         1      piece is probably the one you would pick.  It

         2      wouldn't be flight software or engines or

         3      anything else like that.

         4                Another thing that's kind of near and

         5      dear to my heart is that the HLV retains

         6      essential the contractor and civil servant skill

         7      base that we have right now, especially in              16:19:21

         8      concert with spreading out some of the shuttle          16:19:23

         9      flights that we currently have on the manifest.         16:19:26

        10                I'm very concerned about the                  16:19:28

        11      industrial base.  I'll tell you that, you know,         16:19:30

        12      the congressional budget numbers that have been         16:19:32

        13      provided to NASA basically took away the lunar          16:19:35

        14      program, and that's where all of my space               16:19:40

        15      shuttle civil servants were going to go.                16:19:44

        16                The folks at Marshall were going to go        16:19:46

        17      to Ares V.  The folks at Johnson Space Center           16:19:46

        18      were going to go work on Altair.  Of course, if         16:19:51

        19      the lunar program is gone, I have got to make a         16:19:52

        20      place for civil servants.  And it's just worse          16:19:54

        21      on the contractor side if the lunar program goes        16:19:56

        22      away.                                                   16:20:00

         2      cargo, we talked about that a little bit.  And I        16:20:05


         3      really don't want to get into architecture              16:20:08

         4      discussions, especially with Dr. Crawley because        16:20:12

         5      he knows a whole lot more about it than I do.           16:20:12

         6                But he left, so okay.  Let's talk             16:20:13

         7      architecture for a minute.                              16:20:16

         8                You know, because this is -- that's           16:20:18

         9      not what I'm hear to talk about.  I'm talking           16:20:20

        10      about a capability to provide heavy-lift                16:20:23

        11      capability into low Earth orbit and then off you        16:20:29

        12      go.                                                     16:20:30

        13                I did have a -- because this is a             16:20:31

        14      little bit different than shuttle, see, I had a         16:20:34

        15      short movie, a couple of minutes.                       16:20:36

        16                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Go ahead.                     16:20:36

        17                MR. SHANNON:  I think it just helps           16:20:40

        18      you.  The music is really corny.  I did not pick        16:20:42

        19      up the music on it.  So maybe if the sound is

        20      turned off, I'll tip somebody really good.  Or

        21      not.

        22                And it just shows the build-up of the


                                                              351



         1      vehicle.  And this is very simplistic, right,

         2      but it shows you fairing and there's a whole

         3      bunch of different things.  My graphics guys got

         4      really excited on me here.

         5                What I really want you to see is the

         6      launch and the fairing separations.  Oh, here it

         7      comes.  Great.  No tip for you.

         8                (Whereupon, informational video

         9      began.)

        10                MR. SHANNON:  And as people are

        11      watching, we could ask questions that are really

        12      loud and drowned out the sound, if you would

        13      like.

        14                And this was just a conceptual lunar

        15      lander.  He's on an EDS to be designed.

        16                All right.  That's probably all we can

        17      stand of it.

        18                (Whereupon, informational video

        19      concluded.)

        20                MR. SHANNON:  Okay.  So that gives you        16:22:18

        21      a little better idea.  And, again, I want to            16:22:20


        22      really stress the fact that this has not been           16:22:22

         1      vetted or discussed in the level of detail it           16:22:26

         2      needs to be throughout the entire NASA and              16:22:30

         3      contracting communities.  It's an old idea, and         16:22:35

         4      there's a few changes to an old idea.                   16:22:38

         5                And that's all I was going to present         16:22:40

         6      today.                                                  16:22:42

         7                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Terrific.  That was           16:22:42

         8      very well done.                                         16:22:45

         9                Please, go ahead, Leroy.                      16:22:47

        10                MR. CHIAO:  Thanks, John.  Let's see.         16:22:50

        11      I just wanted to ask you about your first               16:22:50

        12      conclusion, HLV design is less capable than the         16:22:53

        13      current baseline.                                       16:22:59

        14                You mean that it's less capable than          16:22:59

        15      the current baseline because the current                16:22:59

        16      baseline includes Ares V.  Is that correct?             16:23:02

        17                MR. SHANNON:  Yes.                            16:22:50

        18                MR. CHIAO:  Okay.  And so --                  16:22:50

        19                MR. SHANNON:  And the current baseline        16:23:06

        20      is an architecture that has a very large, very          16:23:07

        21      capable lander, and there's no way --                   16:23:07

        22                MR. CHIAO:  Sure.                             16:22:50

         1                MR. SHANNON:  -- to do that on this           16:23:11

         2      vehicle, both from the volume side or the               16:23:12

         3      propulsion side.                                        16:23:17

         4                MR. CHIAO:  Right.  But if we're just         16:22:50

         5      thinking of Ares I -- comparing this to Ares I,         16:23:21

         6      let me make sure I'm understanding that your            16:23:21

         7      numbers are extremely preliminary and haven't           16:23:21

         8      been vetted by the community:  4-1/2 years,             16:23:24


         9      6.6 billion, 72-metric tons of cargo and Orion          16:23:29

        10      with crew to orbit?                                     16:23:35

        11                MR. SHANNON:  With your caveats, I            16:23:37

        12      would say --                                            16:23:43

        13                MR. CHIAO:  With the caveats, right?          16:23:43

        14                MR. SHANNON:  Yes.                            16:23:37

        15                MR. CHIAO:  Okay.  So in that context,        16:23:43

        16      maybe you or maybe Doug can kind of give us a           16:23:44

        17      high level answer -- but, I mean, I'm sure ESAS         16:23:44

        18      looked at this kind of architecture as well as          16:23:47

        19      the Direct-type architecture.                           16:23:49

        20                Can you kind of give us a high big            16:23:51

        21      picture of why the current architecture was             16:23:54

         1      rejected?                                               16:23:57

         2                MR. SHANNON:  It's a require -- well,         16:24:03

         3      no.  It's a requirements discussion.  It's what         16:24:04

         4      kind of lander do you want to put on the Moon,          16:24:05

         5      what kind of capability do you want to put on           16:24:08

         6      the Moon?                                               16:24:10

         7                MR. CHIAO:  So driven by the lander,          16:24:11

         8      right?  Okay.                                           16:24:11

         9                MR. SHANNON:  And they were given a           16:24:13

        10      mission, and they built an architecture that            16:24:15

        11      would support that mission.  This vehicle will          16:24:18

        12      not support that mission.  It will support a            16:24:19

        13      different mission, but we'd have to go and              16:24:24

        14      change that architecture.                               16:24:25

        15                MR. CHIAO:  Okay.                             16:24:25

        16                MR. SHANNON:  Is that fair, Doug?             16:24:25

        17                It's a requirements discussion.               16:23:43

        18                MR. CHIAO:  So it was pretty much             16:23:43

        19      driven by the lunar mission and the lander              16:24:26


        20      requirements?                                           16:24:29

        21                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Why don't you come up         16:24:29

        22      so everybody can hear you.                              16:24:29

         1                MR. COOKE:  I don't think they                16:24:42

         2      actually studied -- or they didn't look at              16:24:43

         3      directly the crewed version of it, because they         16:24:47

         4      considered it a safety issue.  I think probably         16:24:50

         5      because it was next to the tank.  But they              16:24:53

         6      looked at the cargo capability, and they were           16:24:55

         7      looking at the mission overall, I think.                16:24:58

         8                MR. CHIAO:  Okay.  Thanks.                    16:25:01

         9                MR. SHANNON:  And if you automatically        16:25:04

        10      said it was uncrewed, that gives you three              16:25:06

        11      launches, right, because you're going to put the        16:25:08

        12      crew on Ares and then you had your -- you had an        16:25:09

        13      EDS with a lander and another EDS for the crewed        16:25:11

        14      thing that went up.  And three launches is, I           16:25:16

        15      think --                                                16:25:22

        16                MR. AUGUSTINE:  My question relates to        16:25:22

        17      that same sort of line of thinking.                     16:25:23

        18                Many years ago I was involved in a            16:25:26

        19      study where we had actually recommended building        16:25:27

        20      a Shuttle C or something very similar to it, and        16:25:31

        21      at that time it seemed to make sense because you        16:25:36

        22      could pair it with the shuttle.  And so you             16:25:39


                                                              356



         1      didn't have to risk astronauts to provide               16:25:41

         2      trucking and you could use astronauts the fix           16:25:46

         3      Hubbles and the likes and it seemed to make more        16:25:50

         4      sense to us.                                            16:25:53

         5                And today if you were to say you              16:25:54

         6      aren't going to have a shuttle for whatever             16:25:56


         7      reason, if you weren't, then you've almost got          16:25:58

         8      to go to the Orion version or something like            16:26:01

         9      that.  But your reliability figures -- loss of          16:26:05

        10      crew figures, if my memory is correct, showed           16:26:08

        11      the Orion version of what you might call a              16:26:11

        12      Shuttle C derived or something was much less            16:26:16

        13      reliable -- less safe than the Constellation            16:26:19

        14      configuration, and that sort of surprises me.           16:26:26

        15                Could you elaborate a bit?                    16:26:29

        16                MR. SHANNON:  No.  Because I don't            16:26:31

        17      have any knowledge of the Constellation numbers.        16:26:34

        18      I can tell you shuttle program numbers are not          16:26:37

        19      as good as what Jeff presented earlier.                 16:26:40

        20                Our mean is 1 in 81 or                        16:26:44

        21      5 percent/95 percent or 1 in 57 and 1 in 117.           16:26:50

        22      Those are numbers that are very near and dear to        16:26:51

         1      my heart.                                               16:26:53

         2                I think that the effective of the             16:26:54

         3      launch abort system is going to completely drive        16:26:56

         4      what the final number is going to be, and I have        16:27:00

         5      no idea how effective that is going to be               16:27:03

         6      because we haven't studied it.                          16:27:06

         7                MR. AUGUSTINE:  That should be                16:27:06

         8      relatively independent of which vehicle it was          16:27:08

         9      on, though, if that's the driver?                       16:27:11

        10                (Discussion off the record.)                  16:27:11

        11                MR. AUGUSTINE:  No.  Well, we                 16:27:11

        12      shouldn't design vehicles that --                       16:27:11

        13                MR. SHANNON:  Oh, I'd like to.  I             16:27:16

        14      mean, I've had a ball today because, you know,          16:27:17

        15      if you like space, this is kind of neat stuff.          16:27:20

        16                MR. AUGUSTINE:  The other thing that          16:27:22

        17      occurred to me -- I've not been that close in           16:27:23


        18      recent time, but the concern over SOFI peeling          16:27:26

        19      off, that was a problem for the shuttle clearly         16:27:30

        20      because the leading edge of the shuttle was             16:27:35

        21      exposed.                                                16:27:35

        22                With this configuration, would that be        16:27:41


                                                              358



         1      viewed as problem or --                                 16:27:41

         2                MR. SHANNON:  Okay.  The shuttle              16:27:41

         3      program manager piece of me says we fixed that          16:27:42

         4      problem, we're very vigilant about it but we            16:27:43

         5      understand it and have fixed that problem, but          16:27:46

         6      it doesn't matter if we did or not because, of          16:27:49

         7      course, you have a very robust fairing with no          16:27:54

         8      TPS issue at all.                                       16:27:56

         9                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, you have a              16:27:57

        10      different geometry here too.                            16:27:58

        11                MR. SHANNON:  Right.                          16:27:58

        12                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Other questions        16:27:58

        13      from the committee?                                     16:28:04

        14                MR. CHYBA:  Just to follow this up so         16:28:04

        15      I'm sure I understand it.                               16:28:06

        16                It seems like the conclusion is that          16:28:07

        17      the biggest problem identified with this                16:28:08

        18      external system was the loss of crew                    16:28:11

        19      probability, but you showed a graphic -- and I          16:28:15

        20      understand all of the caveats you applied to            16:28:17

        21      everything that you showed us.                          16:28:17

        22                This plot of probability of loss of           16:28:17


                                                              359



         1      crew with the launch abort system, it looks             16:28:22

         2      like, you know, at least at one end of that plot        16:28:25

         3      that one gets into the range for loss of crew,          16:28:27

         4      accidents that the current architecture is in.          16:28:32


         5      Is that correct?                                        16:28:33

         6                MR. SHANNON:  Again, it is completely         16:28:34

         7      dependent on the launch abort system capability.        16:28:38

         8                MR. CHYBA:  So it's just not                  16:28:04

         9      quantified well enough to --                            16:28:04

        10                MR. SHANNON:  You know, and I'd kind          16:28:42

        11      of laugh, right, because after Challenger we            16:28:43

        12      made a big run at trying to put an abort                16:28:46

        13      capability -- or crew capsule capability at the         16:28:50

        14      tip of the orbiter, but you just can't do it            16:28:50

        15      from a weight standpoint -- a design complexity         16:28:54

        16      standpoint.                                             16:28:54

        17                This is basically that same thing.  So        16:28:55

        18      we have some studies that have some of the              16:28:57

        19      dynamics associated with that, but we need to go        16:29:00

        20      back and really go through that and really              16:29:03

        21      understand that.  Because the safety of this            16:29:05

        22      vehicle depends exactly on that one thing.              16:29:07

         1                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  We thank you           16:29:11

         2      very much.                                              16:29:14

         3                MR. BEJMUK:  Real quickly, if I may.          16:29:14

         4                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Oh, I'm sorry.  One           16:29:14

         5      more.  Bo...                                            16:29:14

         6                MR. BEJMUK:  Basically, Doug, LAS has         16:29:14

         7      improved a launch vehicle loss of crew by a             16:29:20

         8      factor of ten roughly.  I mean, you know, John          16:29:20

         9      had this curve but -- and I think you guys are          16:29:26

        10      talking a factor of like 90 percent effective.          16:29:29

        11      So that would increase it by a factor of ten, I         16:29:31

        12      guess, right?  Do you agree with that?                  16:29:35

        13                MR. SHANNON:  Well, it's 90 percent on        16:29:36

        14      top of a rocket, though, and this is a                  16:29:37

        15      different --                                            16:29:39


        16                MR. COOKE:  It's not a rocket failure         16:29:41

        17      and it's --                                             16:29:41

        18                MR. BEJMUK:  Yes.                             16:29:41

        19                MR. SHANNON:  -- different design.            16:29:41

        20                MR. COOKE:  The failure mode is a             16:29:41

        21      rocket, and the trajectories -- the actual              16:29:43

        22      ascent profile differ between different                 16:29:46


                                                              361



         1      designs -- where you are when there is a                16:29:52

         2      failure; if there's a range destruct on a tank,         16:29:57

         3      do you want to be sitting next to it.  It's kind        16:30:01

         4      of -- you know, that sort of discussion can get         16:30:04

         5      into this.  If you're sitting up on top and do a        16:30:07

         6      range destruct, because you're off course, that         16:30:10

         7      tends to look better.                                   16:30:14

         8                I mean, back when I was in the shuttle        16:30:16

         9      program office after Challenger and we were             16:30:19

        10      getting ready to fly Galileo, which had an RTG          16:30:22

        11      on it and we studied the Titan 34D launch               16:30:27

        12      destruct, we looked at -- we looked at the --           16:30:32

        13      how the boosters destructed on Challenger               16:30:36

        14      because they were -- they did a range destruct          16:30:43

        15      after the accident because they kept flying.            16:30:44

        16                They recovered hardware out of the            16:30:48

        17      ocean and looked at how the boosters came part,         16:30:50

        18      and they tended to fly sideways more than they          16:30:52

        19      did up.                                                 16:30:55

        20                So it matters where you are in terms          16:30:56

        21      of what failure and what mode of destruct you're        16:30:59

        22      in.  So, I mean, that's a long discussion --            16:31:01


                                                              362



         1                MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.  Thank you.                16:29:14

         2                MR. COOKE:  -- but those kind of              16:31:03


         3      things do come into play.                               16:31:05

         4                MR. AUGUSTINE:  But by the same               16:31:08

         5      token -- and, again, I don't want to design             16:31:11

         6      rockets here.  Well, maybe I do, but we                 16:31:13

         7      shouldn't.                                              16:31:13

         8                MR. SHANNON:  I do.  Yeah.                    16:31:13

         9                MR. AUGUSTINE:  If you slide the              16:31:14

        10      cargo -- the side mount forward, you could still        16:31:17

        11      have the escape capsule -- you say not?                 16:31:19

        12                MR. SHANNON:  We need to -- I'll              16:31:24

        13      design it.  But the CG becomes a really issue           16:31:26

        14      then, and you end up sacrificing your gimbal            16:31:30

        15      capabilities so you don't -- of course, we don't        16:31:30

        16      have a range package on the ET.  We have them on        16:31:31

        17      the solid rocket boosters, and if we were going         16:31:34

        18      off course, you've got plenty of warning before         16:31:38

        19      the range takes actions.                                16:31:41

        20                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  We probably

        21      should --

        22                MR. COOKE:  It needs to be studied.

         1                MR. SHANNON:  It does.

         2                MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- move ahead.

         3                MR. SHANNON:  That is true about every        16:31:44

         4      single page I just showed -- is it has to be            16:31:47

         5      studied if we want to go look at it.                    16:31:47

         6                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          16:31:49

         7                MR. SHANNON:  You bet.                        16:31:51

         8                MR. AUGUSTINE:  All right.  Let's see.        16:31:52

         9      We're 30 seconds behind here.  Slipping up this         16:31:54

        10      afternoon.                                              16:31:58

        11                We then come to the time for public           16:32:00

        12      comment.  We've allowed up to 30 minutes for            16:32:03

        13      comments.  If there's anyone who didn't comment         16:32:05

        14      this morning that would like to comment, two            16:32:08


        15      microphones are here.                                   16:32:13

        16                We'd certainly welcome comments.  We'd        16:32:14

        17      ask tat you hold them to three minutes or less          16:32:16

        18      so that we can give as many folks a chance to           16:32:19

        19      speak as possible.                                      16:32:22

        20                And I guess we'll start here.  And            16:32:23

        21      will you identify yourself, please.                     16:32:26

        22                MR. SNYDER:  Good afternoon.  My name         16:32:26


                                                              364



         1      is Mike Snyder.  I'm from Houston, Texas, and I         16:32:33

         2      appreciate the opportunity to share my personal         16:32:33

         3      opinions and thoughts with you here today.              16:32:51

         4                You've heard a lot of good ideas and a        16:32:51

         5      lot of different concepts, and so I'd like to           16:32:51

         6      tell you a little bit and maybe bring it a              16:32:51

         7      little bit on to personal side things.                  16:32:51

         8                I'm in my early 30's, and I was born          16:32:51

         9      after Apollo.  My only connection to that               16:32:51

        10      program is the historical pictures and the              16:32:52

        11      videos that everyone sees, the fact that I drive        16:32:56

        12      by the Saturn V's every day laying on the ground        16:32:57

        13      and still get the chance now and again to talk          16:32:58

        14      to the people that used to work on that program         16:33:02

        15      and hear about all of the great efforts that            16:33:04

        16      they did.                                               16:33:08

        17                Of course, I inherited the shuttle,           16:33:09

        18      and while it's an outstanding vehicle with a lot        16:33:12

        19      of great capabilities and it's one that I think         16:33:13

        20      that this nation should not be so quick to give         16:33:15

        21      up, it is limited to only low Earth orbit.  And         16:33:20

        22      we spent the last 30 years there doing that,            16:33:23


                                                              365



         1      basically calling it exploration.                       16:33:26

         2                I have a lot of opinions on this, and         16:33:26


         3      one of my larger opinions is that our current           16:33:28

         4      strategy does not do enough to engage the               16:33:32

         5      private sector and promote the development of           16:33:35

         6      the budding commercial space environment and the        16:33:38

         7      capabilities that they may one day have, such as        16:33:39

         8      the propellant depots that folks talked about.          16:33:43

         9                We do not seem to be -- appear to be          16:33:47

        10      building a true space-fairing architecture and          16:33:48

        11      infrastructure, actively encouraging the private        16:33:48

        12      sector or taking advantage of any of the design         16:33:52

        13      reference missions that have been discussed so          16:33:55

        14      many time and revised so many times throughout          16:33:57

        15      the decades.                                            16:34:01

        16                What we currently have has been               16:34:01

        17      referred to as Apollo on steroids, but Apollo           16:34:03

        18      was labeled unsustainable.  And I ask why will          16:34:03

        19      this time be any different with all of the extra        16:34:10

        20      developments that we have to do.                        16:34:12

        21                With regards to what I mentioned              16:34:14

        22      above, Ares I and Ares V is not what was                16:34:16


                                                              366



         1      recommended in ESAS.  While we have put a               16:34:19

         2      significant amount of money in there, there             16:34:21

         3      obviously have been issues, both technical, cost        16:34:23

         4      and schedule.                                           16:34:25

         5                Second, with the current designs, I           16:34:26

         6      worry that we're going to have two separate             16:34:29

         7      launch developments, two large development              16:34:30

         8      programs, and then the operations costs that are        16:34:32

         9      going to be required to sustain both.  In               16:34:34

        10      today's economic climate, I'm not sure that             16:34:37

        11      that's the best strategic decision we can make.         16:34:40

        12                What I believe we need to do is               16:34:43


        13      leverage the launch vehicle from as much of the         16:34:44

        14      is existing hardware as possible to do the job          16:34:47

        15      required while private enterprise is off                16:34:50

        16      developing its own capabilities.  This allows           16:34:50

        17      for the development costs to be minimized and           16:34:56

        18      operations costs to be forecasted much more             16:34:56

        19      accurately and with higher confidence.                  16:35:02

        20                We heard today both about the                 16:35:03

        21      Jupiter -- the National Launch System derived           16:35:03

        22      vehicle -- and both the side-mounted vehicle            16:35:06


                                                              367



         1      that John just talked about.  This class of             16:35:08

         2      vehicle has been --                                     16:35:08

         3                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Could I ask you to            16:35:13

         4      wrap up --                                              16:35:14

         5                MR. SNYDER:  Certainly.                       16:35:14

         6                MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- your comments,             16:35:14

         7      please.                                                 16:35:15

         8                MR. SNYDER:  This class of vehicle has        16:35:15

         9      sometimes been called overkill for ISS, but it          16:35:17

        10      is exactly that vehicle that we're flying today         16:35:20

        11      to construct and build the Space Station, and I         16:35:23

        12      would like to see that gain serious                     16:35:28

        13      consideration by this program -- by this                16:35:32

        14      commission.                                             16:35:34

        15                Finally, the only thing I have to say         16:35:34

        16      then is that, you know, like I said, I was born         16:35:35

        17      after Apollo.  I sincerely want and hope to see         16:35:36

        18      us go beyond low Earth orbit.  I would like to          16:35:42

        19      be able to do that and have that as part of my          16:35:44

        20      career.  I sincerely hope that my two little            16:35:46

        21      girls, who are very small, don't grow up in a           16:35:48

        22      world where they have to -- too -- look to the          16:35:50

         1      history books to see what we used to be able            16:35:53

         2      to -- what we were, at one time, capable of             16:35:54

         3      doing.                                                  16:35:54

         4                I know y'all have a great job to do           16:35:57

         5      and a very tough job to do, and I appreciate the        16:36:01

         6      opportunity to talk to you.  And whatever               16:36:03

         7      decisions you make, hopefully they're good ones.        16:36:05

         8      Thank you.                                              16:36:08

         9                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          16:36:08

        10                Sir...                                        16:36:11

        11                MR. SIMPSON:  Hi, I'm Randy Simpson           16:36:11

        12      and I'm a taxpayer and an -- (inaudible).               16:36:15

        13                I just want to recall -- I know you           16:36:17

        14      know this and other people have said it -- just         16:36:18

        15      the importance of this review and to think              16:36:22

        16      back -- because this isn't the first one you've         16:36:24

        17      done -- think back in 1990 when you did a               16:36:26

        18      similar review like this and maybe -- and I'm           16:36:29

        19      sure you've done this and gone through your             16:36:32

        20      head.                                                   16:36:34

        21                But I think it would be good for you          16:36:34

        22      and for the panel to think about it maybe out           16:36:35


                                                              369



         1      loud -- to think about what was the environment         16:36:38

         2      back in 1990 technology -- from a technology            16:36:39

         3      perspective, from a political perspective and           16:36:43

         4      think about the process that you went through,          16:36:45

         5      the decisions that you made and how it impacted         16:36:48

         6      the next 20 years and, in looking at that, take         16:36:50

         7      those lessons learned and think to yourself what        16:36:54

         8      the decisions you're going to make now are going        16:36:58

         9      to do for the next 20 years.                            16:37:02

        10                So just think about it from a                 16:37:05


        11      visionary standpoint.  And in the process of            16:37:06

        12      doing that, remember there are a lot of little          16:37:08

        13      eyes that are looking at you.  You know, they           16:37:10

        14      want to know what the next 20 years are going to        16:37:14

        15      be like.                                                16:37:17

        16                There was a discussion about our              16:37:18

        17      youth.  I've got a herd of youth at home in my          16:37:20

        18      family.  They're watching you.  They're watching        16:37:22

        19      NASA.  They're watching me.  They're wanting me         16:37:23

        20      to be excited about NASA, which I am, and for           16:37:25

        21      them to be able to move into the space business.        16:37:29

        22                We need to do something that's going          16:37:32


                                                              370



         1      to, in your recommendations, energize the               16:37:34

         2      current workforce and the workforce that's              16:37:39

         3      coming in later.  This is an amazing place that         16:37:41

         4      we're in.  We're surrounded by Psalm 19 all of          16:37:45

         5      the way around the wall.  We're under Elihu             16:37:46

         6      Root.  I don't know if you know who that is, but        16:37:52

         7      you ought to look it up.  It's amazing.  And            16:37:53

         8      this -- you've got a big job, and I hope you do         16:37:55

         9      it well.                                                16:37:58

        10                MR. AUGUSTINE:  We'll certainly do our        16:37:59

        11      best.  Thank you.                                       16:38:02

        12                Sir...                                        16:38:04

        13                MR. TURNER:  Good afternoon,                  16:38:04

        14      Mr. Chairman and panel.  My name is David               16:38:06

        15      Turner.  I'm from right here in Washington, D.C.        16:38:09

        16      Like many people I was very excited five years          16:38:12

        17      ago in 2004 when President Bush announced the           16:38:15

        18      VSE.  I was very excited about that.  And here          16:38:20

        19      we are in 2009, five years later, and where are         16:38:22

        20      we.                                                     16:38:23

        21                Well, this morning we saw a                   16:38:24

        22      Constellation video, which was very impressive          16:38:28


                                                              371



         1      and would indicate that everything is fine,             16:38:28

         2      we're progressing along, yet I feel that if             16:38:31

         3      things were fine we wouldn't be here today              16:38:35

         4      having this meeting.                                    16:38:38

         5                We've seen a lot of excellent                 16:38:40

         6      presentations this afternoon, and over the past         16:38:42

         7      few years as I've been following this as a              16:38:44

         8      concerned citizen, it seems that there are --           16:38:47

         9      we're only going to -- because of the economic          16:38:49

        10      issues, we're more than likely only going to get        16:38:51

        11      one rocket system that Congress and the                 16:38:54

        12      White House will support.                               16:38:57

        13                I've gotten more concerned that if            16:38:59

        14      Ares I is selected that we're going to end up           16:39:01

        15      only with that, that Ares V won't reach the             16:39:03

        16      funding point when it's time for its                    16:39:07

        17      development.                                            16:39:10

        18                I'm a child of Apollo, and I was a            16:39:11

        19      young teen when the Moon was taken away from us         16:39:12

        20      in the early '70s.  And speaking for my                 16:39:15

        21      generation, I'm still young, I want the Moon            16:39:17

        22      back, I'd like to have it back.  And I'm afraid         16:39:19


                                                              372



         1      that if we only have Ares I we won't get the            16:39:22

         2      Moon again for decades.                                 16:39:25

         3                So it seems to me that whatever rocket        16:39:28

         4      we select needs to have the most                        16:39:31

         5      functionality -- the most flexibility to grow,          16:39:34

         6      and Ares I isn't designed to do that.                   16:39:36

         7                So I hope that the rocket system that         16:39:40

         8      you all choose has that in mind, that it's --           16:39:41


         9      whatever it can do today, it also has                   16:39:46

        10      flexibility for growth in the future to ensure          16:39:49

        11      that we do get the Moon.                                16:39:50

        12                Thank you.                                    16:39:52

        13                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you very much.          16:39:52

        14                Sir...                                        16:39:55

        15                MR. BLAKE:  My name is Earl Blake.  I         16:39:55

        16      am probably one of the only average citizens in         16:39:57

        17      here.  I don't have a dog in this fight, you            16:40:01

        18      know.  I don't care how we launch as long as            16:40:05

        19      it's done safely.                                       16:40:06

        20                You know, I took off work to come down        16:40:09

        21      here to show you and to show everyone that there        16:40:11

        22      are average citizens out there that look to NASA        16:40:15


                                                              373



         1      as inspiration still and has been for the past          16:40:18

         2      50 years.                                               16:40:24

         3                So really actually when I look back at        16:40:25

         4      it, I find that the Space Station when it was           16:40:28

         5      first proposed -- and I was a young father, had         16:40:31

         6      a small one-year old daughter -- now as it's            16:40:34

         7      coming to fruition, I'm a grandfather.                  16:40:39

         8                What I'm really hoping for is that            16:40:43

         9      Orion can come along before I become a great            16:40:47

        10      grandfather.                                            16:40:51

        11                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Or worse.                     16:40:53

        12                MR. BLAKE:  Or worse.                         16:40:54

        13                So what I'm hoping for is                     16:40:58

        14      Constellation really has to be capable, it has          16:41:03

        15      to be safe and it has to be soon or else you're         16:41:07

        16      going to lose another generation of children            16:41:11

        17      and -- that just do not know the excitement of          16:41:15

        18      space exploration.                                      16:41:20


        19                I mean, Dr. Chiao has been to the             16:41:21

        20      Space Station, I believe.  It's exciting for the        16:41:27

        21      person in that position.  For the rest of us on         16:41:29

        22      the -- except for people like me, eh, not so            16:41:33


                                                              374



         1      much.  But, you know, we need to inspire our            16:41:37

         2      youth.                                                  16:41:40

         3                So basically I think what really              16:41:42

         4      should come out of this commission is the fact          16:41:44

         5      that whatever we decide to take, it has to be           16:41:46

         6      supported by Congress for a long term and it has        16:41:52

         7      to be properly funded.  It just -- if the               16:41:54

         8      figures come out and we need this amount of             16:41:59

         9      money to get it done in this amount of time, it         16:42:01

        10      has to be allocated.  We can't go along                 16:42:03

        11      thinking, oh, we'll make it up later, because we        16:42:07

        12      never do.                                               16:42:11

        13                So that's what I'm hoping that you can        16:42:12

        14      do for us.                                              16:42:14

        15                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, thank you very          16:42:14

        16      much for those comments.  Each of you who have          16:42:16

        17      made public comments certainly inspire us with          16:42:24

        18      the importance of what we've been tasked to do.         16:42:28

        19      I assure you we're all committed to do our very         16:42:31

        20      best.                                                   16:42:35

        21                As you can see, this is not an easy           16:42:35

        22      task, and as I've visited on Capitol Hill quite         16:42:38


                                                              375



         1      a bit, I've discovered there are a lot of               16:42:41

         2      different views there too, all strongly held,           16:42:46

         3      mostly contradictory.  So we're aware of what           16:42:49

         4      we're into and we're aware of the importance of         16:42:51

         5      it and we will do our best.                             16:42:54

         6                Let me thank all of you in the                16:42:57


         7      audience who've stuck with us to the bitter end         16:42:59

         8      here today.  We appreciate your interest.               16:43:02

         9                I want to thank the people at NASA on         16:43:05

        10      behalf my colleagues, the people at NASA who            16:43:07

        11      made the briefings and people who provided the          16:43:10

        12      logistics of pulling this all together today.           16:43:14

        13      It was, I think, a very worthwhile day from our         16:43:18

        14      standpoint.                                             16:43:23

        15                Let me just ask if any of my                  16:43:24

        16      colleagues would like to have the last word             16:43:25

        17      here.                                                   16:43:28

        18                Jeff, do you want to or Bo or --              16:43:28

        19                MR. GREASON:  I can't resist the              16:43:32

        20      temptation to say something.                            16:43:32

        21                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Please.                       16:43:32

        22                MR. GREASON:  But so as to be                 16:43:32


                                                              376



         1      noncontroversial -- always something I've said          16:43:34

         2      on a public record before -- you know, and I'm          16:43:37

         3      reminding you of it because of the comments I           16:43:40

         4      got here at the public meeting.  You know, I            16:43:42

         5      stood up on an occasion much like this when I           16:43:45

         6      was on that side of the microphone and I told           16:43:45

         7      the story that, you know, I've had that moment          16:43:48

         8      that we used to be -- used to say about laughing        16:43:51

         9      late when my little boy came to me and said,            16:43:54

        10      Daddy, did they really used to go to the Moon           16:43:59

        11      when you were a boy.                                    16:44:02

        12                And, you know, I am only one of us and        16:44:03

        13      we have a really hard job to do and at the end          16:44:05

        14      of day we make recommendation and other people          16:44:09

        15      have their hard job to do, but if I can, I'm            16:44:12

        16      going to make sure that no -- that when they            16:44:15


        17      grow up their kids don't have to ask that.              16:44:18

        18                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Bo, do you want to add        16:44:18

        19      anything?                                               16:44:23

        20                MR. BEJMUK:  I only have just one             16:44:23

        21      thought.  You know, this gentleman who took off         16:44:24

        22      work to come to talk to us, what resonated with         16:44:26


                                                              377



         1      me was when he said soon.                               16:44:30

         2                You know, this was like the most              16:44:31

         3      powerful word I almost heard today.  We had a           16:44:35

         4      lot of briefings, a lot of fancy stuff, a lot of        16:44:37

         5      clever stuff, smart stuff, and there is a good          16:44:38

         6      citizen who takes off work and he says, guys, do        16:44:41

         7      something soon, and I think this is one area            16:44:44

         8      that we have fallen behind in this country.             16:44:46

         9                I've been in this industry longer than        16:44:50

        10      my memory serves me to remember.  But we have           16:44:53

        11      slowed down in the way we do things.  We do well        16:44:55

        12      things, we do it with little resources, we              16:44:59

        13      somehow have forgotten or maybe never learned or        16:45:02

        14      we didn't think it was important to do things           16:45:07

        15      soon.                                                   16:45:08

        16                And I appreciate what you have said.          16:45:09

        17      We will try to see if we can maybe advise               16:45:11

        18      somebody to do things soon.  Thank you.                 16:45:13

        19                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Leroy...                      16:45:20

        20                MR. CHIAO:  Thanks, Norm.  I'd just           16:45:20

        21      like to say what a great honor it is for me to          16:45:22

        22      serve on this commission, and like my fellow            16:45:25


                                                              378



         1      committee members, I take my responsibilities           16:45:28

         2      very seriously and intend to do the best job I          16:45:30

         3      can to help move the process forward.                   16:45:34

         4                It really touches me to see all of the        16:45:37


         5      folks that came out, people who took time off of        16:45:37

         6      their jobs, people who made a special trip out          16:45:40

         7      to D.C. to participate in the meeting today and         16:45:42

         8      stayed all day really -- I'm also impressed with        16:45:46

         9      people who've come out and made bold                    16:45:47

        10      presentations and statements.                           16:45:49

        11                And, you know, it just shows that             16:45:50

        12      people do care about space in this country, and         16:45:53

        13      I think this commission will play an important          16:45:57

        14      role in ensuring that this country continues to         16:45:59

        15      be a leader in human space flight.                      16:46:02

        16                So thank you all for coming.                  16:46:03

        17                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Ed...                         16:46:09

        18                DR. CRAWLEY:  The task we have before         16:46:10

        19      us is, I think, pretty important, and I think I         16:46:13

        20      want to assure all of you listening today that          16:46:16

        21      we really understand that deeply.                       16:46:18

        22                The previous NASA administrator said          16:46:22


                                                              379



         1      on a number of occasions that the main task of          16:46:25

         2      his administration was to get the first launch          16:46:28

         3      vehicle rolling and get the first spacecraft            16:46:31

         4      rolling and basically the rest of the program           16:46:35

         5      was budget ahead of us and payload on top and           16:46:38

         6      that it would, in fact, be the responsibility of        16:46:42

         7      the next -- now current -- administration to            16:46:45

         8      really decide where we were going to go beyond          16:46:47

         9      low Earth orbit and how we were going to get            16:46:52

        10      there other than with the launch systems and            16:46:54

        11      first spacecraft.                                       16:46:56

        12                And I think that we're at a time and          16:46:57

        13      place in history where the recommendations of           16:46:59

        14      this panel, as we heard from the elected                16:47:02

        15      representative of the people this morning, will         16:47:05

        16      really be listened to, and we take that                 16:47:07

        17      responsibility with great seriousness.                  16:47:09

        18                Someone referenced previous studies.          16:47:13

        19      Norm has chaired these studies before.  Sally           16:47:16

        20      was on both of the accident investigation               16:47:20

        21      boards, Columbia and Challenger.  I happened to         16:47:25

        22      be on the -- 16 years ago when the Space Station        16:47:28


                                                              380



         1      study that was begun in the first year in the           16:47:31

         2      Clinton Administration, called the BEST report,         16:47:33

         3      and one of the outcomes of that report was a            16:47:37

         4      decision to move the Space Station to                   16:47:40

         5      51.5 degrees orbital inclination and invite the         16:47:42

         6      Russians to participate.                                16:47:47

         7                On the morning -- on the day when             16:47:48

         8      Columbia was tragically lost, I had one warm            16:47:50


         9      feeling in my heart that the astronauts who were        16:47:56

        10      then on orbit would not be because of the               16:47:59

        11      recommendation of that committee.                       16:48:02

        12                So these committees do, in fact,              16:48:05

        13      sometimes change history, and I think we're in a        16:48:08

        14      position to do that at this time.                       16:48:11

        15                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you, Ed.                16:48:11

        16                Chris...                                      16:48:16

        17                MR. CHYBA:  Thank you.  First, I'd            16:48:16

        18      like to thank the chairman and my co-panelist           16:48:17

        19      and the presenters today, but above all, the            16:48:21

        20      members of the public who gave us their views.          16:48:23

        21                Our responsibility as a committee,            16:48:28

        22      Mr. Chairman, I believe is to look at a set of          16:48:30


                                                              381



         1      options and present -- look at a very wide set          16:48:32

         2      of options and present a somewhat winnowed down         16:48:35

         3      set of options to the White House and NASA, also        16:48:39

         4      to Congress and to the public.                          16:48:43

         5                I think it's important for us to look         16:48:45

         6      across a very wide number of options and to be          16:48:48

         7      very clear what the choices are, what the               16:48:52

         8      choices are with respect to the goals -- those          16:48:55

         9      options may have different goals that imply             16:48:57

        10      different destinations -- what the choices mean         16:49:01

        11      for national infrastructures and capabilities,          16:49:04

        12      what the choices mean for the time scale, how           16:49:06

        13      soon we will be doing different things and what         16:49:10

        14      the realistic budget requirements for those             16:49:10

        15      different options are.                                  16:49:19

        16                And ultimately the choice is not going        16:49:19

        17      to be made by this group, of course; it's going         16:49:19

        18      to be made by an elaborate dance between the            16:49:21


        19      Executive and Legislative Branches and                  16:49:23

        20      ultimately the American public.                         16:49:26

        21                Our job, I think, is to queue up the          16:49:28

        22      options as clearly as we can so that the people,        16:49:31


                                                              382



         1      through their representatives, can choose.              16:49:33

         2                MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, thank you.  I           16:49:37

         3      guess I would just observe that my small                16:49:39

         4      grandchildren, the two things that I think              16:49:41

         5      excite them the most are space and dinosaurs,           16:49:44

         6      and we're very short on dinosaurs.                      16:49:47

         7                So thank you very much.                       16:49:52
